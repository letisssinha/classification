Abstract—Organizations use business process management to 
identify opportunities to reduce costs, increase service or product 
quality, etc. In this paper, a way to improve businesses processes 
using process mining techniques and standard methods of 
businesses process improvement is presented. Process mining has 
been used to fix the disadvantages of the existing standard 
methods. The presented approach is tested on a real process. 
After the process model is acquired using process mining 
analysis, business process improvement is proposed through a 
detailed analysis. Also, key performance indicators which are 
used to measure process performances, and a process model with 
a new resource allocation, which is improved from the aspect of 
the predefined key performance indications, is proposed. The 
experimental results have shown how the process can be 
improved with a better resource allocation.  
Keywords—business process improvement; business process 
analysis; business process modeling; process discovery algorithms 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Business process management (BPM) has become a new 
concept of management at the end of the previous century. 
Originally, BPM was accepted as a management discipline 
dealing with re-engineering and activity optimization in 
processes. The related economic methods were focused on 
documenting, modeling, and optimization was observed 
separately from IT. Today, BPM includes software products 
which are used by IT for modeling, implementation and 
execution of business processes. In [1] BPM is defined as: 
“supporting business processes using methods, techniques and 
software to design, enact, control and analyze operational 
processes involving humans, organizations, applications, 
documents and other sources of information”. These days, 
business processes are obligated to be globally oriented, as well 
as being able to meet the needs of the group that uses them, 
whether it be employees, business partners, customers or 
management. Systems, as well as the requests, are becoming 
more complex, and the amount of data is getting increasingly 
bigger, in accordance with that it is necessary to use enhanced 
methods for improving business processes. Because of this, this 
paper presents a method which combines process mining 
techniques and the standard method for business process 
improvement. 
The paper is organized as follows: section II presents a 
related work, which methods can be used to improve business 
processes combining similar approaches. Section III describes 
a method of using the presented approaches in business process 
improvement from the theoretical aspect. Business process 
improvement using the presented approach, is demonstrated on 
a particular process in Section IV. The conclusion of this paper 
is given in section V. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Using process mining techniques for improving business 
processes, as well as their combining with “traditional” 
methods of business process improvement is an already known 
topic. Z. Low and others in the paper [2] have presented how 
process improvement can be achieved by analyzing the 
execution history, i.e. by proposing process execution in the 
future, based on log files which contain detailed information 
about participants in the process, and about the duration of the 
steps in the process etc. 
In her thesis [3], K. Gerke used process mining for 
managing and continuous process optimization. A procedure 
for continuous process improvement which detects deviations 
in process execution from the referenced model is presented. 
Deviation is detected by continuous monitoring of the 
execution and comparison to process specifications. Key 
performance indicators (KPI) indicators for the current (AS-IS) 
and enhanced (TO-BE) process model, are defined and 
compared. After that, processes, participants and resources are 
identified in the system, and the causes for the existing of 
differences in defined KPI indicators are analyzed. The 
presented method is tested on multiple processes in the ProM 
tool.  
Paper [4] shows how waiting queues in the process can be 
analyzed using process mining. The authors have proposed the 
installation of predictors in the waiting queues and the results 
of the experiment have shown that predictors have a 30-40% 
higher accuracy in their results compared to the previous 
techniques.  
It is possible to acquire hierarchical process models using a 
set of plug-ins [5]. The authors have implemented the 
presented approach in the ProM tool. The proposed method 
enables to reduce the complexity of the process model, to 
increase comprehensibility, to eliminate unnecessary details 
and it enables to achieve a better focus on the desired features 
of the process model. The simplification of the process model

using process mining techniques is presented in the paper [6], 
and the success of this approach is tested on real event log files. 
In paper [7] a methodological approach for redesigning 
processes based on simulation techniques is presented, along 
with data and process mining tools. The presented 
methodology is comprised of: the problem description, 
determining the process set and identification of the 
participants, gap analysis, defining the project goal, extracting 
log files, discovering real process models, analyzing process 
performances, data mining analysis, analysis of key problems 
in the process, process simulations, improvement of the model, 
what-if analysis and implementation of the solution. This 
approach was experimentally tested in a process of acquisition 
in a private university in the USA.  The combination of process 
mining techniques with simulation techniques is used in 
numerous papers [8-13]. 
III. COMBINING PROCESS MINING WITH CONVENTIONAL 
METHODS FOR BPM 
Process mining can be used to discover, analyze and 
understand business processes based on the run-time behavior 
recorded in event logs [14]. Business processes can be 
analyzed from different perspectives using process mining 
techniques. Those perspectives are: data, organizational, 
workflow perspective and so on. The three main activities for 
which process mining is used are: discovery, conformance and 
enhancement. Using process mining it is possible to acquire a 
process model from the event log file. It is necessary that the 
event’s log files are in MXML or XES format. More 
information about these formats can be found in [14].  
Different algorithms such as the α algorithm, heuristic 
miner, genetic miner, are used for acquiring process models. 
Other than the acquirement of process models from the event’s 
log files, the organizational structure included in the process 
can also be found. That way it is possible to analyze the 
exchange of tasks between the department and user, deploy of 
tasks, identify the participants that cooperate most in the 
process and so on.  
The other way for implementing mining is conformance 
checking. In this case, an event log file is owned on one hand, 
and on the other, a process model. Using process mining, the 
concurrence of the real execution of the process model 
contained in the event’s log files, and the process model, is 
tested. This way deviations, in case they exist, can be detected 
in real models and process models presented on “paper”. 
The third way of using the process mining is enhancing 
process models with additional data about the process such as 
probabilities of branching, duration of task execution, 
dependency between data and flow in the process and so on. 
BPM methodologies have two main goals: presenting the 
execution of the current processes in organizations with 
activities and other corresponding elements, and presenting 
new process models in order to compare their performances 
[15]. 
Traditional methods of acquiring the current process model 
are realized through interviews, surveys, and workshops with 
participants in the process and business process owners. 
Certain disadvantages of this approach exist. This approach is 
time consuming and expensive, especially in the case of 
complex processes in organizations. The biggest problem of 
this approach is that the process can be executed differently in 
reality than it is modeled, i.e. the disadvantages of this model 
are errors and incompleteness of the process. In order to avoid 
this problem, this paper will use process mining techniques for 
acquiring process models. The advantage of this approach is 
that it’s accurate and it enables the acquirement of a process 
model like it is executed in reality, and it is possible to identify 
deviations. This approach is faster and cheaper than the 
traditional. The prerequisite for using this method is that there 
is information about the execution of the business process 
recorded in the log files. 
IV. BUSINESS PROCESS ENHANCEMENT 
A practical use of the presented approach is given in this 
section. The approach is tested on a process of managing 
business processes in a company in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
This paper combines process mining techniques and standard 
methods of business process improvement presented in the 
previous section. 
A. Analysis of AS-IS process model 
As it is described in section III, business processes can be 
analyzed from different perspectives. In this paper, the process 
is analyzed from the workflow perspective. The genetic miner 
algorithm [16] was used for acquiring a process model from 
log files. Unlike the 𝛼𝛼 algorithm, techniques for the heuristic 
and fuzzy mining approach, where the process model is 
acquired in one step and in a deterministic way, evolutionary 
approaches use the iterative method of finding solutions based 
on natural evolution. As with every genetic algorithm, there are 
4 steps: initialization, selection, reproduction and stopping. 
Genetic process mining is flexible and robust. It can deal with 
problems of noise and incompleteness, as is the case with the 
heuristic approach. This approach can be easily adapted and 
expanded. Adaptaion to a particular problem can be done by 
setting the fitness function. The ProM tool [17] was used for 
acquiring the process model (Fig. 1). After applying the 
algorithm, a business process model like on ProM tool [17] 
was used for acquiring the process model (Fig. 2. is 
acquired.The acquired process model is converted to the value 
chain process model. More information about the value chain

process model can be found in [18]. The description of the 
business process steps is given below. 
1) Process identification. The identification process of the 
business process starts with an internal initiative (from the 
company) or an external initiative (outside the company). After 
being accepted, the request is analyzed. Possibilities of 
realization with the help of their own resources and the 
eventual need for the engagement of external resources are 
considered among other things. Based on the analysis, the 
process for improvement is chosen and the project task is built. 
If the project task is not complex then the project task is built. 
If the issue is complex, an expert team is formed for the 
production of the project task, then the team develops the 
suggestion of the project task, which is then sent for revision. If 
the team's opinions for the revision are positive, then the 
suggestion for the project task is adopted. If the team's opinions 
for the revision are negative, then it is sent back for finishing, 
i.e., a re-production of the project task suggestion. When the 
Project task is adopted, then, if external collaborators are 
required, a service is arranged (ensured financial resources are 
required), and then the expert team's solution suggestion is 
produced.  
2) Process modeling and analysis. Analysis and modeling 
of the business process starts with the verification of the AS-IS 
process model by the owner of the process. Deficiencies of the 
verified process model are determined with a simultaneous 
analysis of the cause of the deficiencies and comparison with 
the best practices, which results with a series of identified 
deficiencies of the process, which are then systemized in a 
document. 
3) The proposal of the TO BE model process. Based on the 
document process shortcomings and improvement suggestions 
a suggestion of measures is produced for process improvement, 
then an activity operational plan for process improvement, 
which all together form the study of process improvement 
suggestion. If it is concluded that a revision is necessary, then 
the study revises the revision team, then after a positive opinion 
the study is adopted. If the revision is not necessary, the 
company's administration adopts the study. 
4) Implementation. The end result of the process of 
improving the business process is an implemented, new, 
improved process which is implemented using the process of 
implementation. Based on the improvement proposal a way of 
implementation is chosen, which can be: change of 
organizational structure, change of the process, change of the 
documentation or technological change. After the change in 
the process, the change is documented, and the result is a new, 
enhanced business process, which is documented. 
In order to measure the process performances it is 
necessary to define KPI. KPI present quantitative indicators of 
process execution. A KPIs are grouped into three units: Cost 
KPI, Time KPI i Units KPI.  
Cost KPI 
These indicators hold information about the cost of process 
execution, individual activities in the process, as well the cost 
of the resources engaged in the process. If 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 represents the cost 
of the i-th resource in the process in which m resources are 
engaged on n activities, then the total cost of all the resources 
engaged in the process in a time interval of (𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽) is (1): 
𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟=
∑𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
𝛼𝛼≤𝑡𝑡≤𝛽𝛽
                                        (1) 
Also, a process can have work place costs as well as resource 
costs, such as: cost of workstation, cost of material, etc. If those 
costs are represented by (𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎)𝑗𝑗, then the total cost of the process 
under the assumption that activity n exists in the process is (2): 
𝐶𝐶=
∑𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
𝛼𝛼≤𝑡𝑡≤𝛽𝛽
+
∑(𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎)𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗=1,…,𝑛𝑛
                     (2) 
The total cost of activity I in the process is 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖+ (𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎)𝑖𝑖, then 
the value of the relative cost of the activity is given in relation 
(3): 
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖+ (𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎)𝑖𝑖
∑
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
𝛼𝛼≤𝑡𝑡≤𝛽𝛽
+ ∑
(𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎)𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗=1,…,𝑛𝑛
                        (3) 
The goal in the business process improvement, i.e., 
development of the TO BE process model, is to minimize the 
value given with relation (2). 
Time KPI 
 
Time indicators refer to the time of the business process 
execution (Cycle Time), time of waiting (Waiting Time), a time 
of working (Working Time). Time of the business process 
execution 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 is equal to the sum of the waiting time 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 and 
working time 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 on all activities (4): 
𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐=
∑𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
+ ∑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
                       (4) 
The waiting time 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 impacts the user's satisfaction. It is 
especially necessary to pay attention to this time in the process 
which serve end users, and it is necessary to be minimized. 
This time is related to the number of users that are assigned to 
the activity and it can be written 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖= 𝑓𝑓(𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖). Also, this time is 
inversely proportional to the number of resources 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖~ 1 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖
⁄
. 
Units KPI 
This indicator indicates process instances. The total number 
of executed process instances 𝑁𝑁, the number of process 
instances on activities 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖, the usage of resources 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖. All these 
parameters are connected to each other and it is impossible to

observe them separately. The change of any of these 
parameters directly impacts the change of others parameters. 
These parameters can be measured using relations (5), (6), (7): 
𝑁𝑁=
∑𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖                                   (5)
𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛
 
𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖= ⌈𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖
𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖
⌉                                      (6) 
𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖=
𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖
𝛽𝛽−𝛼𝛼                                      (7) 
where 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 is the average duration time for activity i. 
Cost KPI is related to time KPI through a number of human 
resources in the process. The larger the number of engaged 
human resources is, the larger the Cost KPI is. On the other 
hand, with a correct allocation of resources the time KPI can be 
decreased. When the number of resources in the process is 
smaller, the Cost KPI is smaller as well, but the time KPI is 
potentially larger. 
The defined KPI indicators are used for measuring the 
performances of the AS-IS business process model.  
B Proposal of the TO-BE process model 
With the foundation of the process analysis „Managing 
business processes“ the following weak spots of the process are 
identified: 
1) The sub-process „Business Process Governance“ is 
missing, 
2) Adopted documents Framework for BPM and BPM 
politics don't exist, 
3) Business processes are not mapped on strategic goals 
of the company, 
4) There's no IT support for the process „Managing 
business processes“ on the whole, with a special emphasis on 
modeling and quantitative business process analysis, 
5) There is no standard form for a description of the 
business process, 
6) There is no defined evaluation methodology for 
suggestions/initiatives for improvement, 
7) There is no defined evaluation methodology for 
suggestions/initiatives for improvement, 
8) A standard form for proposing improvement initiatives 
is not identified, 
9) There is no continuous control and measurement of  
performances of the business process. 
The following methods for business process improvement 
are established. 
1)  Improvement through process model change 
The identified improvements which are classified as the 
business process improvements, refer to the proposal of 
business process flow or the establishment of a new 
process/sub-process, because the business process analysis 
identified redundancies in the process activities, process breaks 
or shortcomings of the clearly structured activity sequence. 
2) Improvements through change of organizational 
structure or business rules 
Business rules are definitions or restrictions of a certain 
business part. The rules are business politics excerpts and 
company practice. One of the applications of business rules is 
through defining business processes. The goal of the business 
rule is to controle or impact the performance of the business 
process, i.e. the business. The fact is that a organization's 
business changes over time, so it is necessary to change the 
business rules according to that. The business rule always 
needs to be set so it is possible to accurately determine its 
applicability, i.e. it is always clear what it means, what and 
who it refers to.  
3) Improvements through digitalization of business 
processes 
Process improvements which are directed to digitization of 
the business process, are focused on improvement through IT 
process support. The essence of the process doesn't change 
with this type of change, instead, it improves through increase 
in efficiency and automatization of certain activities.  
4) Improvement of resource allocation in the business 
process 
This method of improving the business process implies a 
better allocation of current resources in the business process, as 
well as the eventual engagement of new human resources in the 
process.  
The proposed TO-BE process model is given in Fig. 3 [18]. 
The changes which are proposed in the TO BE process 
model are given below. 
1) Establishing 
the 
subprocess 
„Business 
Process 
Governance“. During identification of the AS-IS process it is 
established that the business process governance with which 
the mandate to the center of business process excellence is 
given, to follow and effectively manage business process, and 
identify and publish process owners. Governing business 
processes entails defining, making and implementing 
guidelines, rules, politics, which initiate responsibilities and 
activities during the entire life cycle of business processes. 
2) Develop and adopt documents Framewrok for BPM 
and BPM politics. The main activities in the process 'business 
process governance' are production and adoption of documents 
framework for managing business processs, and politics of 
managing business processes, which, together with the 
methodology 
for 
managing 
business 
processes 
and 
conventions of modeling, present a mechanism for real 
business process management. 
3) Business processes are not mapped on strategic 
company goals. The company's strategy is executed through 
the company's business processes, and therefore it is necessary 
within the 'process business process governance' to map which 
process impacts the execution of which strategic goal, in order 
for the execution of the strategy to be as effective as possible.

Other than that, mapping processes on strategic goals will give 
an insight to which processes are critical, i.e., key processes 
for execution of the strategy, and those processes will have a 
higher priority during the evaluation and selection of 
initiatives for improvement.  
4) There's no IT support for the process „Managing 
business processes“ on the whole. There's no IT support for 
the process „Business process governance“ on the whole, with 
a special emphasis on modeling and quantitative business 
process analysis. This disadvantage is already acknowledged 
from the company, and it is entailed in the project 
„Implementation of the software platform for design and 
managing business processes“, in which this document was 
made, software for managing business processes was acquired, 
which are mostly gonna be used in modeling activities, 
analysis and business process implementation. 
5) Standardized form. It is necessary to adopt a 
standardized form for business process description within the 
methodology of managing business processes. 
6) Standardization and adoption of the improvement 
suggestion/initiatives evaluation methodology. Identification, 
classification 
and 
improvement 
suggestion/initiative 
methodology adoption is proposed within the methodology for 
managing business processes.  
7) Production and adoption of the form for the 
improvement initiative suggestion. Within the entire business 
process 
improvement 
„Managing 
business 
processes“, 
production and adoption of a standardized form „Initiative for 
business process improvement“ is proposed, with which a 
mechanism would be established where all owners can, 
according to the Sector for managing business processes, 
direct a suggestion for business process change/improvement.  
Process controlling and business process measurement 
introduction. In order for the business process management to 
be executed based on the business process performances, i.e., 
real numbers, an integration of the BPM system with 
transaction systems is proposed, which support the execution 
of particular processes, in order to be able to follow the 
process execution in real time and to follow the previously 
defined KPI indicators. 
8) Resource allocation in the process [10]. Analysis of the 
AS-IS process model established that the total number of 
allocated human resources in the process is 16. Three are 
allocated on the subprocess Process identification, two are 
allocated on the Current state analysis, as it is presented in 
table 1.  
The proposed number of resources is also presented in table 
1. For determining the proposed number of resources a 
simulation model was previously built [12]. For testing model  
SimEvents library was used from Matlab. The previously 
defined KPI indicators were measured: price of resources in the 
process 𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 and the total resource utilization 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖. Fig. 4 shows 
the current share of the resource prices in the process, and it 
also shows that the largest expense is on sub-processes 
Implementation and Process modeling and analysis. The 
expenses are formed taking into account the number of  
resources, price of resources (work price) as well as the price 
of the work place. Fig. 4. also shows the share of the resource 
prices, according to the proposed resource allocation. Resource 
utilization is analyzed for the proposal of resource 
improvement in the business process (Fig. 5.) and the current 
expenses allocation (Fig. 4.). The black bars represent the

resources which can be used in some other processes in the 
organization. The results were presented to a company that will 
further decide about the business process improvement, but the 
procedure of process changing is slow and long. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents an approach for business process 
improvement using process mining and standard methods for 
business process improvement. First, the AS-IS process model 
is acquired. In order to get the current process model the way it 
is executed in reality, the genetic miner algorithm from the 
class of process discovery algorithms is used. KPI indicators, 
which are used for measuring the current process being 
executed, are defined. The TO-BE process model which is 
susceptible to a process flow change, is proposed. Other than 
the change of the process flow, a way of working on some 
activities in the process is proposed. Performances of the 
process are measured from the aspect of resource usage and 
their cost in the process. A new resource allocation is proposed 
on the current process in order to ensure better resource usage. 
For KPI measurement, the simulation model was previously 
built.
