Abstract: In order to adapt to ever-changing customer needs and satisfy them, good Business
Process Management (BPM) in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is crucial. The target
group of this research is production SMEs whose BPM can be monitored respecting the values
of key performance indicators (KPIs). This paper shows how improving the performance of the
observed business processes can improve the level of customer satisfaction. This improvement should
lead to the sustainability of SMEs in the market. In this paper, evaluation of business processes
performance is deﬁned as a multi-criteria decision problem. The relative importance of considered
KPIs and their imprecise values are described by linguistic expressions, which are then modeled by
triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs). Calculation of KPI weights is done by using the
fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Evaluation of BPM success is conducted respecting the
obtained KPI weights and KPI values. An optimal solution for BPM success improvement, respecting
customer satisfaction indicators, is calculated using the Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic
Algorithm (GA) approaches. By applying the proposed model, managers of production SMEs can
determine the management initiatives that will improve their business and the sustainability of
their companies.

1. Introduction
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) present a driving force of economic
development in many countries. According to [1], SMEs represent 99% of all businesses in
the EU. In Serbia, this number is 99.8%, employing 2/3 of the total number of employees in
the non-ﬁnancial sector and participating with 32.8% in the formation of gross domestic
product (GDP). However, the survival rate of SMEs is not high. In recent years, the number
of SMEs that have survived the ﬁrst two years of business in Serbia is around 60% [2].
Production SMEs, which employ a vast number of people and signiﬁcantly affect the
overall growth of the economy, are especially vulnerable. To ensure their survival in the
market, SMEs must successfully manage their business processes. It is very important that
these enterprises continually improve their business processes, which leads to improved
efﬁciency. The question is, what can help the managers of production SMEs in this situation?
As SMEs have limited resources, the answer lies in Business Process Management (BPM)
supporting models and software that would suit their needs. On the other hand, for the
survival and success of these enterprises in the market, their focus on meeting customer
needs is vital.
Until recently, organizations were concentrated only on the processes, focusing on how
they operate, neglecting that the customer and their interaction to business processes are

important [3]. However, according to [4], identiﬁcation, analysis, and control of processes
should be performed in convergence with customer experience, and not be addressed
independently. These authors suggest that to achieve a great customer experience, excellent
business processes are required. Convergence between these concepts may lead to many
beneﬁts: designing of business processes that enable customer expectations fulﬁllment,
development of products and services that are needed by the customers, rational usage
of organizational resources, and more. According to [5], BPM is an important factor in
attaining high levels of customer satisfaction.
However, customer satisfaction is a complex issue [6]. According to [7], it refers to
the level of customer satisfaction with products and after-sales services as well as the
level of customer complaints. According to ISO 9000:2015 standard, customer satisfaction
is “customer’s perception of the degree to which the customer’s expectations have been
fulﬁlled” [8].
According to [9], customer satisfaction leads to their retention, and the transfer of
satisfaction information leads to the acquisition of new customers. In this way, there is also
an increase in market share and an increase in proﬁtability because retaining customers is
drastically more cost-effective than replacing them. Generally, customer satisfaction is one
of the key indicators of business performance [10]. In a highly volatile market, such as the
current-day market, with many competing companies offering similar products, customer
satisfaction and loyalty are often seen as something that sets a company apart from the
competition and is a critical element of business strategy.
In the literature, most of the papers dealing with determining customer satisfaction
are related to service activities [6,11–18]. On the other hand, fewer papers focus on manu-
facturing companies [19–22], while a signiﬁcant lack of literature has been noted regarding
the link between the performance of their business processes and customer satisfaction.
Based on a review of the literature related to BPM, theoretical foundations, and
empirical research related to the use of Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic
Algorithm (GA), an integrated conceptual model has been developed to guide this research.
The proposed model is used to ﬁnd out whether it is possible to integrate ANN and GA to
determine optimal business performance values that would result in improved customer
satisfaction in certain business conditions.
ANN presents a powerful tool that can be used to model relationships in data sets
that are nonlinear and highly correlated. Like real biological neural networks, ANNs are
composed of interconnected, simple processing elements called artiﬁcial neurons. A neural
network is a connected set of neurons or nodes. Like biological neurons, each ANN neuron
receives input information, processes it, and delivers output information. The input can
be a rough set of data or an output from another neuron, and the output may be the ﬁnal
result, or it may be the input for another neuron. In biological neurons and synapses,
there are synaptic connections of different strengths, and these strengths are represented in
the ANN neurons by the values of the weight coefﬁcients. When processing information,
artiﬁcial neurons in the ANN perform simultaneously and collectively, with the ability to
learn, self-organize, and support robustness [23].
Since organizations always have to meet several different business goals, it is necessary
to compromise, make optimal decisions, and not jeopardize any of the set goals in such
situations. These goals can often conﬂict with each other, i.e., by reaching one goal an
organization may move away from reaching another goal, and vice versa. Examples
of conﬂicting goals are high quality and low cost, greater efﬁciency, and more excellent
reliability. Due to the possibility of considering many factors that inﬂuence decision-making,
a GA is a suitable method for ﬁnding optimal solutions. In the past few years, GA has
been among the most exciting optimization techniques within artiﬁcial intelligence since
modern technology has found a way to commercialize its application [24,25]. GA belongs to
stochastic methods for ﬁnding optimal solutions [26] and is characterized by a signiﬁcantly
higher speed of ﬁnding solutions than classical methods and ﬁnding approximate optimal
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697
3 of 22
solutions in situations where classical methods cannot provide the precise optimal solution.
It is particularly suitable for solving multi-criteria optimization problems [27].
GAs are well-known methods for the efﬁcient search of complex spaces. Combining
ANN for prediction and GAs to optimize business performance allows companies to
improve business process management while reducing costs and increasing customer
satisfaction. This approach gives SME managers important information regarding process
parameter values, which are needed under different business conditions and different
stages of the process to obtain the desired level of customer satisfaction indicators’ values.
This paper is organized in the following way. The literature review is presented
in Section 2, and the methodology and proposed algorithm are shown in Section 3. An
illustrative example is presented in Section 4, and conclusions are given in Section 5.
2. Literature Review
This manuscript attempted to show how improving the performance of the observed
business processes can improve the level of customer satisfaction. According to [28], the
BPM paradigm could be considered as an integral part of almost all essential quality man-
agement paradigms (TQM, Standardized Management Systems such as ISO 9001, Lean, Six
Sigma). These authors state that the integration of BPM into quality management systems
and tools enables the development of effective and efﬁcient organizations. Since the BPM is
an integral part of the above-mentioned paradigms, we placed our focus on the connection
of BPM and one of the key principles of SMS ISO 9001, focus on customers’ satisfaction.
According to [28], the axis of the BPM philosophy and the implementation of its
principles is the satisfaction of customers’ needs. BPM assists managers of SMEs in achiev-
ing business objectives [29]. One of the most important business objectives is customers
satisfaction. Key performance indicators (KPIs) as measurable values demonstrate how
effectively a company is achieving key business objectives. Meaning that KPIs have crucial
importance in the measurement and determination of target values. It is clear that achiev-
ing the desired target value is not possible without effectively implementing BPM [30].
Improving business processes performance is possibly be accomplished by monitoring
and managing the KPIs of these processes [31]. Different studies are focused on business
process improvement based on KPIs during the BPM [32,33].
However, determining the relative importance and values of KPIs is a difﬁcult task
because precise numbers cannot always present these variables. They often depend on the
experience and opinion of decision-makers, so there are uncertainties in their determination.
According to [34], uncertain and imprecise variables can be described by linguistic terms.
Modeling of these linguistic terms can be done by using the theory of fuzzy sets [35,36].
Many papers deal with the modeling of linguistic variables. While several authors use
type-1 fuzzy sets [37–40], other authors suggest using type-2 fuzzy sets [41–44] because of
a higher degree of freedom and ﬂexibility. In the previous research, there are many papers
using intuitionistic fuzzy sets [45–47]. Although using intuitionistic fuzzy sets requires
complex calculation, the authors of these papers claim that they present a better way of
describing uncertainties that occur in modeling linguistic variables.
Different models for supporting BPM in SMEs have been developed in the previous
studies based on fuzzy sets. These models allow managers to make decisions more quickly.
In the paper [48], a fuzzy approach for evaluation of the quality of the purchasing process,
respecting weights and values of KPIs for deﬁned process’ objectives, is presented. Using
this approach, managers can identify gaps between existing and target conditions of
process effectiveness, identify strengths and weaknesses, and improve purchasing process
performance. In the papers [49,50], fuzzy group decision-making problems for determining
the weights of identiﬁed quality KPIs for the manufacturing process were considered.
Ranking of manufacturing sub-processes and their KPIs was done by using a metaheuristic
approach. These mathematical models enable quality evaluation of a production process,
ranking, and optimization of KPIs using a GA. This approach enables managers of small
and medium enterprises to improve successfully the production process quality. The
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697
4 of 22
authors in [51] used modiﬁed fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to obtain the fuzzy
rank of business processes of a seaport. The assessment of the relative importance of each
pair of performances and their KPIs are stated as a fuzzy group decision-making problem.
The ranking of business processes is based on the overall preference index and the method
for comparing fuzzy numbers. In [52], the authors were solving the problem of assessment
and improvement of KPIs in the New Service Development Process. Determination of
KPIs’ weights was stated as a group decision-making problem. The ranking of KPIs
was performed by using the GA approach. Determination of the management initiatives
priority for the improvement of KPIs was based on fuzzy if-then rules and the single-
objective GA. This model enables identifying weak points in an enterprise and determining
corrective measures that should lead to the improvement of the process performance.
In [53], the authors developed a fuzzy model for ranking manufacturing sub-processes
in the automotive industry, respecting the sub-processes’ KPIs. This model, which uses
the fuzzy extended ELECTRE III method for ranking considered sub-processes, enables
improving quality management by assessing manufacturing sub-processes and their KPIs.
Mathematical models developed in all of these papers use triangular fuzzy numbers
to deal with uncertainties in the considered problems. On the other hand, according to
many authors [45,54], intuitionistic fuzzy sets present a better way to model linguistic
terms characterized by a degree of imprecision. These fuzzy sets [55] represent an extension
of classical fuzzy set theory. Their fundamental characteristic is the existence of the non-
membership function and the membership function instead of standard fuzzy sets. One of
the models for supporting BPM in SMEs, based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, is shown in [56].
In that paper MCDM approach was used to rank production SMEs, respecting values
and weights of KPIs of the production process. Modiﬁed TOPSIS method with triangular
intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) was used while the benchmarking procedure was
proposed to identify weaknesses in performance management and to choose appropriate
improvement strategies. In [57] proposed model was extended to four processes, and a
software solution for dealing with this problem was shown, which signiﬁcantly shortens
the time required to obtain a solution. In this paper, modeling of uncertainties is done
using TIFNs, while modern artiﬁcial intelligence techniques and approaches, like ANN and
GA, are used to establish a link between business processes performance in manufacturing
SMEs and customer satisfaction.
ANNs have proven to be a promising computing system in many forecasting and
business applications due to their ability to learn from data sets, their nonparametric na-
ture (i.e., no rigid assumptions), and their ability to generalize [58]. Their application is
widely used in business performance [59], most recent internet ﬁnancing [60], performance
management [61], and online education and teaching evaluation system performance pre-
dictions [62]. The authors in [59] used ANN as the prediction system to predict e-business
performance for the Chinese service industry. In their study, for the backpropagation (BP)
ANN model, the inputs are the data of e-business performance measured by a ﬁve-point
Likert scale, and the expected outputs of training neural network come from cluster analy-
sis. The results showed that the prediction system is reliable and accurate; and that it can
be used for evaluating enterprise performance effectively. In [63], authors compared ANN
and multiple linear regression (MLR) prediction performance on reliability of accounting
information system as independent variables and business performance as a dependent
variable prediction model and revealed that in terms of predictive accuracy test, the ANN
has higher accuracy than regression analysis. In [60], the author presented the application
of the BP ANN method to analyze the risks of Internet ﬁnance in terms of market, law,
credit, personal information, and professional knowledge. The same authors stated that
BP ANN had an excellent prediction effect. According to [62], a combination of GA and
ANN has given good optimal results for social science research performance evaluation in
colleges and universities. Similar research was conducted in [61], where authors proposed a
performance index system for university social science research based on BP ANN and the
relevant theoretical knowledge. The presented BP ANN models have shown meager error
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697

value and good generalization abilities, which effectively demonstrates that the training
sample data can ideally ﬁt the neural network simulation. In the same way, it shows that
the output value of the BP ANN can be very close to the input vector.
GA has been applied and provided acceptable optimal results in many problems: pro-
cess scheduling problems [64], system parameter determination problems [65], data mining
process optimization [66], and KPI value optimization [49,52]. In [64], authors proposed
a self-learning GA (SLGA) which adopts GA as the primary optimization method, with
its key parameters intelligently adjusted based on reinforcement learning (RL). The same
authors compared the learning effect and performance of SLGA in solving the Flexible Job
Shop Problem (FJSP) with other algorithms using two groups of benchmark data instances
with different scales. Their experiment results show that the proposed SLGA signiﬁcantly
outperforms its competitors in solving FJSP. In [65], the GA-based two-step classiﬁcation
method is proposed, which allows selecting the signiﬁcant factors and adapting the model
itself to application in bankruptcy forecasting, improving the advantages and alleviating
the weaknesses inherent in standard classiﬁers enabling the business decisions to support
with higher reliability. In [66], new ensemble data mining techniques that involve an
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANGIS) with GA for landslide spatial modeling
have been presented, showing that the proposed ensemble data mining techniques can
be applied for land use planning and management of landslide susceptibility and hazard.
Literature resources show that GA has its application in obtaining optimal values within
the production process KPIs, the ranking of KPIs, and provides the basis for successful
improvement of the production process quality [49,67]. Furthermore, the ranking and im-
provement of the new service development process KPI values problem could be stated as
a multi-criteria decision-making problem that the GA could solve [52]. It can be concluded
that GAs has provided scheduling, trend tracking, and ﬁnding optimal performance values
in various ﬁelds and that they can be used to ﬁnd the optimal solution in many scientiﬁc
and industrial ﬁelds.
3. Methodology
This paper intends to assess optimal improvements for BPM in SMEs, which should
lead to increasing the level of customer satisfaction. In order to achieve this, KPIs for
each business process must be deﬁned. Since there are no standards that deﬁne the most
appropriate KPIs for each business process, it is common practice to determine KPIs based
on the literature data and the results of good practice. The ﬁrst issue that arises in this
problem relates to the assessment of the relative importance of KPIs. The second issue
relates to the determination of the KPIs’ values. The problem is signiﬁcantly more complex
because the realistic assumption is that the considered variables are not measurable so
linguistic terms will describe them.
In this paper, linguistic variables are modeled using the TIFNs that belong to intu-
itionistic fuzzy sets [55]. Assessments of the relative importance of KPIs for each business
process are stated by fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix, an analogy to Analytic Hierarchy
Process (AHP) method. According to [68], this method is very transparent and easy to under-
stand. The AHP method [69] has been widely used for various decision-making problems.
Its extensions have been applied in numerous papers, for example, FAHP with Triangular
fuzzy numbers, developed in [70] and used in [71,72]; FAHP with Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers
applied in [73,74]; FAHP with the interval type-2 triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers
used in [75,76]; FAHP with TIFNs developed in [77] and used in [68,78–81], etc.
In this paper, to determine the weights of KPIs, decision-makers estimate the relative
importance of KPIs. Since the calculated weights of KPIs depend on the assessment of
decision-makers, it is very important that these decision-makers have sufﬁcient knowledge,
such as quality management auditors, or managers with a lot of experience. They use
linguistic expressions modeled by TIFNs (Table 1), as shown in [57]. Domains of these
TIFNs are deﬁned on the interval from 1 to 5. To determine the relative importance of KPIs,
value ‘one’ means equal importance, and value ‘ﬁve’ means extremely important.

More important
eA3 = {(2, 3, 4), ( 1.8, 3, 4.2)}
Strongly more important
eA4 = {(3, 4, 5), ( 2.7, 4, 5)}
Absolutely more important
eA5 = {(4, 5, 5), ( 3.7, 5, 5)}
According to the conventional AHP method, consistency checking should be per-
formed, ensuring the entered data’s consistency. Since the problem analyzed in this paper
is a group decision-making problem, KPI weights are calculated using the fuzzy geometrical
mean method and then aggregated using the fuzzy averaging operator.
On the other hand, decision-makers (managers above all) of each SME involved
in determining optimal values of BPM success estimate KPI values for each business
process. The imprecisions related to the assessment of KPI values are described by linguistic
expressions modeled by TIFNs, as shown in Table 2, according to [57]. Domains of TIFNs
describing these imprecisions are deﬁned on the interval from 1 to 9.

ev3 = {( 2.5, 3.5, 4.5), (2.3, 3.5, 4.7)}
Middle value
ev4 = {(4, 5, 6), ( 3.8, 5, 6.2)}
Fairly high value
ev5 = {( 5.5, 6.5, 7.5), ( 5.3, 6.5, 7.7)}
High value
ev6 = {( 7, 8, 9), ( 6.7, 8, 9)}
Very high value
ev7 = {(8, 9, 9), ( 7.7, 9, 9)}
Based on the aggregated weights and the estimated values of KPIs, current ratings of
BPM success at the level of each business process are calculated, as shown in Section 3.1.
When it comes to monitoring customer satisfaction, speciﬁc indicators also must be
deﬁned, and in this paper, it is assumed that their importance is equal. This allows these
indicators to be observed and improved at once. In case the observed company has a desire
to observe and improve only one indicator, for example, which it considers to be the most
important at the moment, the input data for ANN and GA will contain only data for that
indicator. Their values are also estimated by decision-makers of each involved SME and
described by linguistic terms shown in Table 2.
Based on the calculated BPM success ratings, an ANN model is then developed
to predict the values of satisfaction indicators in a speciﬁc SME. A GA then uses the
trained ANN model to determine the BPM parameter values that would result in optimal
satisfaction indicator values obtained in various operating conditions.
GA optimizes goals using objective functions and constraints to ﬁnd the optimal
solution in the domain of possible solutions. Objective functions and deﬁned constraints
are usually in conﬂict, so solutions have acceptable values instead of optimal values for
all goals. Unlike the optimization of one objective function (single-criteria optimization),
with usually only one obtained optimal solution, in multi-criteria optimization, with more
target functions to be satisﬁed, the number of resulting solutions is signiﬁcantly higher
(trade-offs). Multicriteria optimization consists of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, the given
target functions are optimized, and solutions are obtained in the form of a Pareto front
(set), while in the second phase, a decision is made on the speciﬁc solution to be selected
from the Pareto set. The Pareto set is a set of mutually non-dominant solutions, so the ﬁnal
decision is up to the decision-maker. For Pareto solutions, the property is that they are
harmonized based on dominance. Dominance refers to the fact that some solution A is
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697
7 of 22
dominant over solution B, if it has a more optimal value concerning solution B for at least
one objective function, and it does not have a higher value for other objective functions.
Using the fuzzy algebra rules [82,83], ANN and GA approaches, the links between
BPM success and customer satisfaction indicators can be found. Based on that, the optimal
values for BPM parameters are determined while maximizing the values of customer
satisfaction indicators. Since ANN and GA are used in the proposed algorithm, the obtained
results largely depend on the number of observed SMEs and entered values. By determining
the gaps between current and optimal values of BPM success, the management team of
each SME can conclude which business process requires performance improvement.
3.1. The Proposed Algorithm
This section presents the 17-step procedure for evaluating optimal BPM improvements
in SMEs, respecting the values and weights of KPIs. The presented algorithm intends
to provide theoretical background for the development of software solutions. Using this
solution, SMEs could have tools for fast and efﬁcient insight on their process as well as a
tool that will detect the major gaps between existing situations and optimal situations. This
will provide a useful tool to SMEs that was available, until now, only for the large systems.
Step 1. The fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix of the relative importance of KPIs i, i’
on the level of each business process p are stated, based on the assessments of each expert q:

Step 3. Consistency is performed according to the procedure presented in [69]. If the
consistency index of each given matrix is <10%, it is considered that the matrix is consistent,
and no corrections are necessary.
Step 4. Weights of each KPI i, at the level of each expert q and at the level of each
business process p are calculated using the methodology shown in [68]:

of BPM success (RBPMS) for each process within each enterprise are obtained:

Step 11. Using predeﬁned linguistic statements, decision-makers within each enter-
prise e estimate the fuzzy ratings of the indicators of customer satisfaction (ICS): eve

Step 12. By using the linear normalization procedure (step 7 of the algorithm), these
ratings become comparable: ere

4. Illustrative Example
As well as in other countries of the world, manufacturing SMEs operating in Serbia
gain a signiﬁcant role in the country’s economy. This is why the proposed algorithm’s
application is tested on data given from 30 manufacturing SMEs operating in this country.
These companies belong to the sector of the metal processing industry, which is very
important for the development of Serbia. In accordance with [57], four key business
processes for manufacturing SMEs which are observed in this paper are: (1) purchasing
process, (2) production process, (3) marketing and sales process, and (4) after-sales service
process. In compliance with the existing literature and the results of good practice, KPIs for
each of these processes (Table 3) were determined.

On the other hand, the observed indicators of customer satisfaction, determined in the
same way, are: (1) degree of fulﬁllment of customer requirements, (2) customer satisfaction
with quality, (3) customer loyalty, and (4) customer satisfaction with the implementation of
the contract. Customer requirements are the desired characteristics of products that should
be met in order that the customer will decide to purchase the product. Satisfaction with
product quality refers to products’ technical and functional characteristics that are subject to
complaints [86]. Customer loyalty represents the degree of customers retention [87], while
satisfaction with the implementation of the contract refers to all the elements speciﬁed in
the sales contract, which the company is obliged to fulﬁll. It is assumed that the importance
of these indicators is equal.
Data collection was performed by collecting ﬁlled-up questionnaires, as shown in [57].
In order to determine the weights of KPIs, for each process, six experts q were engaged.
Their fuzzy assessments of the relative importance of KPIs are shown in [57]. Furthermore,
in the mentioned work, input data for the KPIs’ values are given, based on the assessments
of managers from each of 30 SMEs. These assessments are presented in Appendix A. In
order to evaluate the values of indicators of customer satisfaction, data in Appendix B were
collected, also based on the assessments of managers.
Based on the collected data, the proposed algorithm is tested.
Demonstration of the Algorithm
Figure 2 presents the fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix of the relative importance of
KPIs for the purchasing process, assessed by expert q = 4. He gave his statement based on
his knowledge and experience (Step 1 of the Algorithm). Here, the decision-maker used
ﬁve predeﬁned linguistic expressions which were modeled by TIFNs.

After that, for each element of the stated fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrices, de-
fuzziﬁcation was performed to check the consistency of the entered data (Step 2 of the
Algorithm). The defuzziﬁcation method is illustrated in an example of the TIFN

In the same way, scalar values of other elements of the fuzzy pair-wise comparison
matrices were calculated. An example of obtained pair-wise comparison matrix with scalar
values is given in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Pair-wise comparison matrix for the purchasing process.
Using the existing procedure Consistency Index was calculated (Step 2 of the Algo-
rithm). Its value is 0.05, so this matrix may be considered consistent, and it is not necessary
to re-evaluate the relative importance of KPIs. In the same way, the consistency of other
pair-wise comparison matrices was checked.
By using Step 4 of the Algorithm, the weight of KPI i = 1 of the purchasing process
(p = 1), at the level of expert q = 4, was calculated as:
ew41
1 =

= {(0.087, 0.1758, 0.369), (0.0805, 0.1758, 0.3993)}
where em41
1 = {(0.6444, 1, 1.5519), (0.6203, 1, 1.6122)}.
In the same way, weights of the rest considered KPIs, obtained by each expert, are
calculated at each business process level.
By applying Step 5 of the proposed Algorithm, aggregated weights of each KPI at
the level of each business process are obtained (Appendix C). In accordance with this, the
weight of KPI i = 1 for process p = 1 is calculated as:
ew1
1 = {(0.1720, 0.3274, 0.5771), (0.1581, 0.3274, 0.6328)}
In Step 6, fuzzy assessments of the KPIs’ values, at the level of each business process,
were estimated by decision-makers of each enterprise using seven predeﬁned linguistic
expressions which were modeled by TIFNs (Appendix A).
The application of Step 7 of the proposed Algorithm is illustrated by the example: let
the value of KPI (i = 1) at the level of business process p = 1 in enterprise e = 1 be described
by TIFN:
ev11
1 = {( 7, 8, 9), ( 6.7, 8, 9)}
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697

The normalized value of this beneﬁt-type KPI is calculated as:

= {(0.7778, 0.8889, 1), ( 0.7444, 0.8889, 1)}
In the same way, normalized values of all KPIs for all business processes in each
enterprise were calculated.
Using Step 8 of the Algorithm, the weighted normalized values of all KPIs for each
business process in each enterprise were calculated. An example illustrates this for KPI
i = 1 of process p = 1 in enterprise e = 1:
ed11
1 = ew1

1 =
{(0.1720, 0.3274, 0.5771), (0.1581, 0.3274, 0.6328)}
·{{(0.7778, 0.8889, 1), ( 0.7444, 0.8889, 1)}}
= {(0.1338, 0.2910, 0.5771), ( 0.1177, 0.2910, 0.0.6328)}
In the same way, the weighted normalized values of all other KPIs are calculated.
After that, fuzzy ratings of BPM success at each enterprise’s level of each business
process are calculated using Step 9 of the Algorithm. Obtained fuzzy rating for process
p = 1 in enterprise e = 1 is:
eO11 = {(0.0631, 0.1826, 0.3599), ( 0.0528, 0.1826, 0.3916)}
Finally, using the defuzziﬁcation procedure (Step 10) representative scalar of this
rating is obtained:
RBPMS11 = 0.1997
In the same way, scalar ratings of BPM success at the level of each business process
for each enterprise are calculated. These ratings are later used as input data to obtain
optimization equations (Appendix B).
In Step 11 decision-makers assess ICS, using predeﬁned linguistic statements, which
are then modeled by TIFNs. Let the ﬁrst ICS i = 1, in the enterprise e = 1, be described by
the linguistic expression “High value”. This expression is then modeled as TIFN:
ev1
1 = {( 7, 8, 9), ( 6.7, 8, 9)}
In Step 12 of the Algorithm, this value is normalized and calculated as shown in Step 7,
so the obtained result is:
er1
1 = {(0.7778, 0.8889, 1), ( 0.7444, 0.8889, 1)}
By using the defuzziﬁcation procedure in Step 13 scalar rating of ICS i = 1, for enter-
prise e = 1, is calculated:
RICS1
1 = 0.8847
In the same way, the RICS of all indicators in all enterprises are calculated, and they
also present input data for obtaining the optimization equations (Appendix B).
In Step 14, ANN is used to obtain optimization equations based on the RICSe
i as
dependent variables, and RBPMSep as independent variables, i = 1, ..., I; e = 1, ..., E; p = 1,
. . . P. A backpropagation ANN with two layers is used, and appropriate weights and
biases are calculated, as shown in Appendix C.
In Step 15 of the Algorithm, the limits of all RICS values are set to be 0.97, as it is the
maximum value of RICS. The goal is to achieve the optimal scores for all RICS at once,
which is as close as possible to the value of 0.97. By using the GA, optimal RBPMS for each
process are obtained (Appendix D). It can be seen that there are nine solutions, and in this
example, the ﬁnal solution (see Table 4) was chosen as optimal because it has the highest
scores of all RICS observed.

Based on the results obtained, each enterprise can identify gaps between current and
optimal RBPMS values for each process (Step 16). The results for the enterprise e = 23 are
shown in Figure 4. n the same way, scalar values of other el
Figure 4. Results for enterprise e = 23.
Based on Figure 4, managers of SME e = 23 can see that the highest gap between the
current and optimal values is for processes p = 4, i.e., after-sales service process, and this
means that this process needs the greatest improvements. On the other hand, it is seen that
the production process (p = 2) does not need improvement. According to the enterprise’s
strategy, managers of this SME should decide which methods of the business processes
improvement will be applied (Step 17 of the Algorithm). There are different possibilities,
depending on their opinions and available resources.
In order to improve the process with the highest gap, managers of this SME can be
focused on the calculated weights of KPIs for the after-sales service process, obtained in
Step 5 of the Algorithm. The most important KPI is “% of complaints resolved in time”,
which is a beneﬁt type KPI. It means that corrective actions may ﬁrstly be aimed to increase
the value of that KPI. In order to improve this indicator, business managers of the observed
SME should consider whether it is necessary to increase the number of employees involved
in resolving complaints or perhaps to carry out their additional training. After that, the
manager may focus on the improvements of other KPIs. These improvements can be
realized through better communication with customers and proper execution of complaints,
respecting all customer requirements, their advice, and suggestions in accordance with
service recovery practice.
After that, the decision-makers of SME e = 23 can decide to implement strategies
that should improve the purchasing process. In this process, the most important KPI is
“% of complete orders”, a beneﬁt type KPI the value of which should be increased. This
can be achieved by choosing suppliers who have a better reputation and who are more
responsible towards their associates. Managers can also focus their attention on other KPIs,
but since those KPIs refer to the quality and time for which the suppliers are responsible,
the best way for the KPIs improvement is to carry out the process of evaluation, ranking,
and selection of appropriate suppliers correctly.
In the end, looking at the obtained results, it can be seen that KPI with the most
signiﬁcant importance for the marketing and sales process is “% of realization of sales
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697

plan (quantitative)”. It means that corrective actions may ﬁrst be aimed to increase the
value of this KPI. This can be done by aligning the sales plan with realistic possibilities,
improving marketing activities, and using new forms of promotion. Other ways to improve
this process are more careful planning of marketing activities, including determining the
promoter, the order in which promotions are performed, the number of funds required,
improving product delivery time, etc.
5. Conclusions
In order to develop their business and survive in the market, production SMEs must
constantly satisfy the customers of their products. Increasing customer satisfaction may
lead to increased proﬁts, which is important for the sustainability of SMEs.
The paper contributes to creating a BPM management model that improves the art’s
current state on methodological and substantive bases with two contributions: integrating
new information and using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. The proposed model is used
to ﬁnd out whether it is possible to determine the link between the BPM success, which
depends on the KPIs of business processes, and customer satisfaction. Therefore, on the
basis of calculated weights and values of KPIs, RBMPS ratings for each process within each
enterprise are obtained. On the other hand, there are ratings of the indicators of customer
satisfaction (RICS), within each enterprise. Using ANN and GA the links between these
two types of ratings are discovered and optimal solutions of RBMPS are proposed while
maximizing the RICS values. So, by improving the values of KPIs, RBMPS ratings will be
improved, which should lead to the improvement of RICS values, i.e., customer satisfaction.
The results provide evidence on how to separate the different performance dimensions
to identify a direction for improvement of customer satisfaction. There were two primary
scientiﬁc objectives. The ﬁrst objective was to develop a model for assessing the process
KPIs and customer satisfaction RICS indices from various aspects. The second objective
was to develop an optimization model to support the decision-making process and to
make optimal decisions to improve individual process KPIs based on RICS desired levels.
Accordingly, a mathematical model with an accompanying 17-step algorithm was proposed.
The ﬁrst part of the algorithm refers to determining ratings of BPM success and RICS
values. This is done by a fuzzy mathematical model where existing uncertainties and im-
precisions are modeled by TIFNs. These numbers are used in the proposed model because
they present a good way of modeling human thinking. Since the issue of determining the
weights of KPIs is stated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, fuzzy AHP approach
and fuzzy averaging operator are used. Aggregated weights and normalized fuzzy ratings
of KPIs are used to obtain ratings of BPM success for each process in each SME. On the other
hand, fuzzy ratings of ICS values in each enterprise were normalized and then defuzziﬁed
using the fuzzy algebra rules.
The second part of the algorithm uses ANN and GA approaches to determine the
optimal scalar ratings of BPM success for each process within an SME. A two-layered BP
ANN is used to calculate appropriate weights and biases. They are then used in GA in
order to determine the optimal RBPMS for each process. The goal is to achieve the highest
possible scores for all RICS at once. Based on these results, it is possible to determine the
gaps between current and optimal ratings and to propose optimal improvements for each
SME. This is very important for SMEs operating in today’s changing environment.
The algorithm was tested on the data from 30 manufacturing SMEs operating in Serbia.
It has been shown that there is a signiﬁcant relationship between the observed business
processes and ICSs. This allows the determination of the optimal level of improvements
of business processes in an exact manner. Based on the obtained results, some of the
methods for the business processes improvement are explained, which should lead to the
improvement of customer satisfaction.
The proposed algorithm is very ﬂexible. It allows the observation of a large number
of SMEs, their business processes, KPIs, and ICS simultaneously. This is very important
to obtain the most accurate results since they largely depend on the number of observed
Sustainability 2022, 14, 1697
15 of 22
SMEs and entered values. Additionally, having data from different companies enables
benchmarking, meaning that each company could compare their results with the results of
other companies.
The practical implications include determining a decision support system that will
enable the adoption of optimal decisions by the SMEs management team to improve the
values of the process KPIs and customer satisfaction. The presented system may enable
benchmarking, simulation, and veriﬁcation of different scenarios to improve the process
KPIs’ and customer satisfaction RICS values of the SMEs.
The originality of the research lies in the presented two-part model that can be made
available to SMEs and serve as a basis for determining future strategic directions.
However, collecting data from companies is not always an easy task, as they are not
always willing to provide information. Furthermore, as in many genuine problems, the
main disadvantage of the proposed model is obtaining input data of maximal accuracy
because they depend strictly on the knowledge and the experience of the decision-makers.
Besides, there is also a risk of their subjectivity when ﬁlling in the data.
Future works could test the developed methodology in other industrial branches, with
other KPIs or ICS. Additionally, different types of ANN and optimization constraints could
be applied.
