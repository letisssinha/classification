Abstract
The different types of business management systems provide the functionality for 
management of business enterprises by enabling the maintaining of data about the 
management of all types of resources used in business. The statistical data helps us 
in revealing of information about the functioning of enterprises and the implementa-
tion of information communication technologies (ICT). Our research area concerns 
the methods for evaluation of ICT access and usage in businesses and possibilities to 
evaluate a variety of different types of used systems. The access and usage of ICT by 
business enterprises have differences and is quite complex for evaluation. Countries 
provide statistical data about the level of ICT usage. An approach presented by this 
research include some methods for multi-criteria decision support by applying the 
TOPSIS, AHP and SAW methods. As the case study we demonstrate the evalua-
tion of ICT usage in small and medium enterprises of business of Lithuania in com-
parison with other countries. The TOPSIS method provides the structure of decision 
making which help to evaluate the distance between the level of ICT usage in busi-
ness of some countries of EU. Empirical research results show disparities of evalu-
ation of countries by ICT usage in business according to the dynamic perspective.

1  Introduction
In the recent decade extraordinary changes were achieved in numerous business 
areas, including manufacturing industry, retail sector and other sectors. It is seen 
that information technology (IT) assets are being renovated and re-engineered on 
regular basis in the areas of bookkeeping, marketing and sales, finance planning, 
supply chain management, production and human resources planning. This move

could be explained by business willingness to reduce the costs and to create higher 
benefits for clients that leads to higher efficiency rates and profits.
The IT usage in businesses enterprises is differentiated between different size and 
types of the companies. Business use IT in different intensity and it could create dif-
ferentiated opportunities to seek for efficiency. Even though countries have general 
statistical data about the level of IT usage, more analytical techniques seems to be 
required to evaluate differentiations between companies and countries in IT usage in 
achieving outputs from IT usage.
There are different studies that tried to evaluate a level of usage of information 
and communication technology (ICT) in business (Premkumar 2003; Ceric 2015). 
Z. Mastilo and others evaluate the impact of digital growth in modern business 
(Mastilo 2017). The ICT usage was comparatively high, despite the fact that there 
were no conceivable outcomes of e-business (Bocij et al. 2015). The study points 
were to mirror the usage of ICT as an interface between the private and open area. 
It is likewise proposed to portray the current ICT implementation and benefits in the 
business uncovering up to what degree they address with the organizations’ issues 
for further business advancement.
Bedeley et  al. (2018) contend that manageability of this area focuses can be 
improved impressively on the off chance that taxpayer supported organizations are 
implanted. In any case, for the ICT implementation to be converted into beneficial 
returns, the organization must embrace a learning focused ICT framework. This is 
substantiated by information sharing, between hierarchical connections, and the 
commitment to the goals of the certain contention among maintainability and mon-
etary development.
The aim of this research is to analyze differentiations of ICT usage in small and 
medium enterprises (SME) by enabling the evaluation of sustainable development of 
business. Special view is paid for business management systems and ICT usage dif-
ferentiation in business and their benefit. For achieving this aim the main objectives 
of research are as follows: to analyze the possibilities of application of multi-criteria 
decision making methods for evaluation of ICT usage in business development; to 
analyze the methods for recognition of different alternatives of decision making in 
the ICT implementation area of business enterprises. We demonstrate the results of 
the evaluation of ICT usage in SME of business in Lithuania in comparison with 
other countries (Latvia, France, United Kingdom, and Greece). It supported the idea 
that multi-criteria decisions making methods could be applied to compare ICT usage 
between different countries in dynamic time perspective.
2  Benefits of implementation of ICT and BMS in business
The different types of ICT are used for managing and optimizing various tasks 
in business organizations (Wier et  al. 2007; Dzemydiene and Baltrusaitis 2015; 
Bazaras et al. 2010). The attention of the scholars is put on finding solutions for the 
problems of business process management and organization while focusing on the 
following aspects:
325
1 3
Application of multicriteria decision aid for evaluation…
•	 What are the conceptual models of collaboration and interoperability of separate 
business segments and organizations;
•	 When is the organization mature and ready to install the business management 
processes, ICT and e-services;
•	 How to classify the e-services and ICT dedicated to the business processes;
•	 How to estimate and determine the efficiency of the innovative activities of busi-
ness, and its changes.
A particular emphasis can be analyzed by paying more attention on the issues 
of intangibility and multiplicity of the innovative activity assessment. The analyzed 
problems and offered solutions are related to the largest business entities, thus either 
ignoring the small and medium-sized business sector or assessing it by applying 
only the methods and indicators of measuring its productivity.
We are trying to found the indicators and methods of measuring the efficiency of 
business process infrastructure, which would meet the requirements of the SMEs by 
implementing innovative ICT.
The problematic research field of the effective organization of business process 
infrastructure support is topical, especially with the emphasis on the context of a 
scarcely analyzed particularity of SME, with regards to both theoretical and practi-
cal approaches analysis of the application of the e-services in the business process 
infrastructure (Arsanjani et al. 2015; Ceric 2015). Multiplicity of the evaluation pos-
sibilities led to the conclusion that the concept of a value chain can be reasonably 
applied as a platform for organization of evaluation activities (Saha 2011; Bedeley 
et al. 2018). Despite of grouping into the traditional quality control, business princi-
ples and ICT application based on the classification of value chain evaluation meth-
ods, it might be claimed that utilization of ICT measures and tools in the infrastruc-
ture process has an immediate influence on the levelling of the relative distribution 
boundaries. We would like to provide the classification of evaluation criteria on the 
basis of multi-criteria compromise approach by grouping the analyzed criteria into 
three categories (quality, price, performance), following the M. Porter’s value chain 
model and other recommendations provided by (Saha 2011). The criteria system is 
based on the concept of value chain creation, evaluation of its separate elements 
and developing of the basis of the combination of parameters of price, quality and 
performance. Such a system of criteria becomes a universal tool that allows SMEs to 
evaluate the effectiveness of their activities and their compliance with the needs of 
consumers (Fig. 1).
Number of minimization parameter of SME entity’s value creation chain con-
stituent elements should be emphasized as it improves its activity efficiency 
characteristics.
The choice of ICT for improving the processes of business has been a chal-
lenging task for SME (Kale et al. 2010). By analyzing the layers of information 
infrastructure, as ICT support of business organizations, we can divide it in 7 lay-
ers. Even though they are connected with each other, they have different types of 
system support possibilities (Fig. 2). The common information infrastructure of 
business organization contains different layers: a layer of law and legal systems, 
a layer of management and control, a layer of technical equipment (hardware), a 
326
	
D. Dzemydienė et al.

layer of software, a layer of databases, a layer of information systems, and a layer 
of decision support systems that could be related with different types of ICT. 
There are different types of management information systems (MIS) and busi-
ness management system (BMS) that vary from the type of enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) systems, such as provided by IT corporations, for example as 
SAP, Microsoft versions of BMS as Axapta, Navision, Dynamics, Green plain, by 
Oracle Business Suite, or open source ERP and CRM systems as ODOO, Sugar 
CRM and etc. (Kale et al. 2010; Karimi et al. 2007; Møller 2005; Shaul and Tau-
ber 2012; Law and Ngai 2007), until Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) (Mar-
janovic 2007; Sun 2016). Expert systems are used as well, and are helpful for 
knowledge management in business and for improvement of their functionality 
(Dzemydiene et al. 2019).
A business can attain the following advantages with the implementation of man-
agement information systems (MIS) (Taticchi et al. 2010), such as: an economy of 
scales; a balancing conflicting requirements; a flexibility and a responsiveness, and 
many others. With the help of MIS all operations of the business can be combined 
and information can be supplied at a very fast rate from one department to another. 
The volume of advanced developments and the effect on current business is more 
prominent than can be seen from the present point of view. It ought to be noticed 
that extensive organizations in their look for the likelihood of business enhancement 
have perceived ICT as a factor to raise issues related with prohibited actions. Gov-
ernments and administrations of global organizations are attempting to empower 
the advancement of inventive exercises in hardware and interchanges of ICT (Ceric 
2015).

Application of multicriteria decision aid for evaluation…
While various innovations are applied to help in e-commerce, including 
e-information trade (EDI) and e-finance exchange (EFT), a standout amongst the 
most conspicuous advances for business supposed to be the internet and its usage 
possibilities (Lee et al. 2010; Shiels et al. 2003).
The comparison of methods for evaluation of business performance and ICT 
implementation we would like to provide by describing the spectrum of propos-
als of approaches and methods for developing of quality management of business 
during the historical point of view (Table  1). Some evaluation possibilities by 
implementing the framework which help us to overview the main approaches pro-
vided for business management in the world, and which help us to summarize all 
provided possibilities of ICT means for business.
The PMM, i.e. Performance Measurement and Management framework is pro-
vided by summarizing of such approaches described in works of (Taticchi et al. 
2010; Shaul and Tauber 2012; Arsanjani et al. 2015). The methods of influencing 
business quality and management have be evaluated in parallel with developing 
processes of innovative ICT which support infrastructure components of business 
processes and re-engineering (Table 1).

3  An approach for evaluation of differentiation of ICT usage in SMEs
A lot of multi-criteria decision-making (MCA) methods have been created and pro-
posed in literature. The MCA methods have been adjusted and connected to tackle 
refined functional and logical issues. We can found a variety of strategies depend-
ent on multi-criteria utility hypothesis and different decision making methods pro-
vided as the Simple Additive Weighting method (SAW) (Memariania et al. 2009), 
the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
(Krohling and Pacheco 2015), COPRAS (Zavadskas et al. 2016), and review of dif-
ferent decision making strategies provided by (Zavadskas et al. 2009). The multi-
criteria basic leadership could be connected to survey diverse choices of future exer-
cises. Following by Zavadskas et al. (2016) “the multiple criteria analysis (MCA) 
gives a structure to breaking an issue into its constituent parts. MCA gives a way to 
examine various options in light of clashing needs”.
Some of multi-criteria decision-making methods were compared in order to 
select the most suitable for ICT assessment opportunities in terms of the value chain 
for SMEs. Based on the nature of primary data (the level of evaluation criteria sys-
tem) and characteristics of the data availability, some methods are analyzed such as: 
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the SAW, and the TOPSIS. The structure is 
developed for evaluation of ICT usage by implementing of AHP and SAW methods 
and is presented in (Fig. 3). For the application of the TOPSIS method the imple-
mentation structure can be very similar.
Given the examples of best practice when several methods are combined, a con-
ceptual method for business process infrastructures adjustment was developed on 
the basis of the concept of a value creation chain. The application of multi-criteria 
evaluation principles in the activities of value creation evaluation enables optimiza-
tion of activities at minimal cost by maximizing compatibility of different value cre-
ation chain elements with one another as well as with consumer expectations. The 
scientific literature of 2004–2018 mostly focuses on four models of value creation 
chain evaluation as Balanced Scorecard (BS), Supply Chain Operations Reference 
model (SCOR), Data Envelopment Analysis model (DEA) and Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP). That establish DEA and AHP principles, which are widely used for 
solution evaluation of engineering, mathematical, social problems (Zavadskas et al. 
2016).
For this research two methods (the TOPSIS and the SAW) have preference as 
more applicable for needs of evaluation of ICT access and usage in SMEs.
3.1  Explanation of application of TOPSIS method
The TOPSIS method, developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981 and applied in 
many other works, can be treated as a technique to judge the performance of 
alternatives through the similarity with the best solution. Following by the work 
of (Krohling and Pacheco 2015) in which “the simplest different would be one 
that’s nearest to the positive-ideal solution and farthest from the negative-ideal 
331
1 3
Application of multicriteria decision aid for evaluation…
solution. The positive-ideal solution is one that maximizes the benefit criteria and 
minimizes the price criteria. The negative-ideal solution maximizes the price cri-
teria and minimizes the profit criteria. In summary, the positive-ideal solution 
consists of all best values possible of criteria and also the negative-ideal solution 
consists of all the worst values possible of criteria.”
We would like to follow the recommendations of the TOPSIS application pro-
cess (Krohling and Pacheco 2015), as applicable steps of algorithm, which is car-
ried out as follows:
Step 1 Construct the decision matrix and determine the weights of criteria. (The sum 
of all the weights should be equal to 1).
Step 2 Calculate the normalized decision matrix:

where nij normalized decision matrix.
Step 3 Calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix.
where 휈ij weighted normalized decision matrix.
wj the weight of the j-th criterion.
Step 4 Determine the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions.
where I is associated with benefit criteria and J with the cost criteria, i = 1, …, m; 
j = 1, …, n; and V+ positive ideal solution; V− negative ideal solution.
Step 5 Calculate the separation measures from the positive ideal solution and the 
negative ideal solution.
where S+
i  separation measure from positive ideal solution and, S−
i  separation meas-
ure from negative ideal solution.
Step 6 Calculate the relative closeness to the positive ideal solution.
where Pi positive ideal solution.
Step 7 Rank the preference order.
3.2  Possibilities of application of the SAW method
The SAW method is often also known as weighted summing method in which the 
main aspect is to find the weighted sum of performance ratings on each alternative 
on all attributes. The SAW method requires the process of normalizing the decision

matrix to a scale comparable to all existing alternative ratings. By following of rec-
ommendations how the SAW method is carried out, we follow such steps (Memari-
ania et al. 2009):
Step 1 Construct the decision matrix and determine the weight of criteria. (The sum 
of all the weights should be equal to 1).
Step 2 Calculate the normalized decision matrix.

minj rij the smallest i-th criterion’s value for all the alternatives compared.

i = 1, … , m;
j = 1, … , n , m the number of the criteria used, n is the number of the 
objects (alternatives) compared.
Step 4 Calculate the sum.
Step 5 Rank the preference order.
The one of the limitations of the SAW method is all the criteria must be positive 
so if we have the negative values they should be transferred to the positive values. 
The transformation can be done as follow:

to reveal more common evaluation of situations of this complex phenomenon for 
reviewing of advancements during the period of 2013–2017 years. The structure of 
more detailed information about such statistical data include the indicators which 
represent the data about businesses with website or home page, businesses using 
ERP, CRM systems, electronic data interchange (EDI), systems for receiving orders 
over computer networks, usage of supply chain management systems (SCM), RFID 
functionality, etc.
4.1  Evaluation of main statistical data on ICT usage in business by using TOPSIS 
method
The results of Step 1 by following the TOPSIS method, demonstrate the construc-
tion of matrix by using data from the Official statistics (https​://stats​.oecd.org) by 
representing the access and usage of ICT (in percentage) by businesses of five coun-
tries of EU during the period from 2013 until 2017 years (Table 2). The weights are 
chosen as 0,2 and performed as equal for all cases of 5 year periods by giving the 
same weights in dynamic perspective, because the assessment of year periods have 
the same starting positions, and Sum of weights have to be equal to 1.
The results of Step 2 of TOPSIS method are provided in Table 3. The numbers 
in the table represents the results of that particular year for a particular country after 
calculating the normalized decision matrix (Table 2).

The results of Step 3 are provided in Table 4 by representing the data of that par-
ticular year for the particular country after the calculation of the weighted normal-
ized decision matrix.
Results after determination of the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions are 
presented in Table 5.
The separation of measures from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal 
solution are calculated by the Step 5 of the algorithm of TOPSIS method and the 
results of ranking are obtained during Step 6 and 7 of TOPSIS method (Table 6).
4.2  The example of evaluation of ICT access and usage in businesses by using 
SAW and AHP methods
We are trying to use another MCA method as SAW for the same purposes by apply-
ing the same statistical data. The starting decision matrix is presented in Table 7. 
The weights are taken as maximum and equal for all countries, because the access 
and usage of ICT in SME businesses are of the same starting position of analyzing 
of 5 countries, and the sum of weights should be more, but not less than Sum = 1.
Results of normalized matrix by implementing maximized criteria are demon-
strated in Table 8.
The results of Step 3, Step 4, and Step 5 of SAW method are presented in Table 9 
in which the sums and ranks of each country according to the usage of ICT in busi-
nesses during 2013 to 2017 years are calculated.

The provided methods allow to show which country ranks first in ICT usage. By 
the evaluation of ICT usage in Lithuania in comparison with the other countries we 
can know how Lithuania has a sustainable development in business by implement-
ing ICT.
Anyhow there are some limitations of using SAW method, such as we cannot use 
the negative values and if there are negative values in the statistics, they should be 
converted into positive values and because of this there is a chance of losing some 
important data and the evaluation may have some errors and one more limitation 
of this method is all the criteria in the data should be maximum and not minimum 
which results in errors in the evaluation. However, in this analysis we have used 
the SAW method as there are no negative values in the statistics and the criteria of

using the ICT is always maximum and the results obtained by using the TOPSIS and 
SAW methods were comparatively similar. The provided methods allow to reveal 
which country ranks first in the ICT usage and the level of differentiation between 
countries.
For more detailed evaluation of ICT access and usage in businesses, the question-
naire for specialists—experts was developed with respect to find out the preferences 
of criteria. The method applied there is related with the specific of AHP method. 
Specialists-experts are from the management field of ICT implementation in differ-
ent SME’s, and they were asking about the preferences of using of innovative ICT 
tools. All questions form factors which are representing in the Table 10 by same 
number:
1.	 How the inter branch and inter-market communication is affected by ICT? (Such 
question forms 1 Factor in the Table 10 naming it as “Communication”).
2.	 To what extents the business data collection are effected and utilized by the ICT?
3.	 If the data collection method is not 100% compatibility with the business, how 
much it affects business growth?
4.	 Is it necessary to hire the skilled employee or employee skill must be developed 
at the more grounding level?
5.	 Data management methods and data collection method are not available at 
low cost, is it necessary to reduce the expenditure on them or new methods are 
required?
6.	 Every employee has to know the data is safe or data access has to be open to every 
employee?
7.	 If information sharing is very important at what level it shows the effect on the 
business model?
8.	 What are the odds and evens of ICT on business profit growth?
By taking the above questionnaire, experts provide the weights as follows by pre-
senting them in Table 10, and by showing the preference level of such criteria in 
business, and how this factors affect the value chain of business (Tables 11, 12).
In the market, every organization is trying to protect the employee information, 
at the same time employee has to understand the necessity of the ICT. Practically 
the entirety of the respondents has concurred that there are a constraint experienced 
IT experts with the capacities to plan and actualize the precise custom-fitted frame-
works in accordance with the overall conditions exceptional to the nation just as the 
particular organization.
5  Conclusions
The phenomenon of ICT access and usage in businesses is very complex and cor-
responds to the implementation of vide spectrum of technologies and systems pro-
vided for business. The proposed methods for quality management of business var-
ied and became more complex with application of novel methods proposed in time

perspective. The problems of choosing the well-grounded and reasoned solutions are 
important in the organizations of business and influence the processes of the infra-
structure changes. Making the most appropriate decision in a given situation turns 
into a multi-criteria challenge that can affect the business organization’s in the oper-
ational prospects. Comprehensive assessment of business organization for prepared-
ness to ICT innovations are influenced by parameters and criteria of preferences of 
using informative and objective indicators, which help to reduce the likelihood of 
possible wrong decisions and avoid the negative consequences of performance.
The versatility of the evaluation criteria allows the comparison and evaluation of 
the many alternatives offered for SMEs on the market, which are treated as separate 
infrastructure elements and can help to increase the efficiency of the value chain. 
The SME entity have possibility to evaluate the value chain processes (their con-
stituent elements) using a common set of valuation criteria (combinations of val-
ues) and replace the non-compliant elements with one of the many alternatives on 
the market. Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) can be used to evaluate 
alternatives in a timely manner based on a combination of criteria. They are used 
to find the optimal solution and are divided into two groups: multi-objective and 
multi-objective.
Despite the wide range of applications, all problems solved by the multi-criteria 
decision-making method have some common features: alternatives are evaluated 
against several indicators; the evaluation criteria may conflict with one another; the 
measurement indicators may have different units of measurement.
The expediency of applying the principles of multi-criteria evaluation in the field 
of management is also determined by the tendency that single-criteria evaluation 
methods cannot solve problems in complex technology or marketing systems.
For evaluation of ICT usage in small and medium enterprises of business some 
methods were choose. For evaluation of ICT usage in SME of Lithuania in compari-
son with the other countries we can evaluate Lithuanian case and distance from the 
other countries. The spectral use of IT as business management systems (BMS) and 
some of their benefits is revealed in a paper. The limitations of this research that five 
countries were involved and two multi-criteria decision making methods were used 
(TOPSIS and SAW). In future we would like to expand this research by getting the 
expert’s evaluations of statistical data by using other multi-criteria decision making 
methods such as Kendell coefficient of concordance and analytic hierarchy process 
(AHP).
According to the scientific literature, the choice of the most appropriate method 
for solving the problem is usually determined by the nature of the information avail-
able. After evaluating the application of the methods in practical tasks, the number 
and different dimensions of the evaluated criteria and their possible alternatives, the 
level of competence of the potential users of the method and the resources man-
aged are analyzed and the SAW, TOPSIS and AHP method combination are applied. 
One of the features of the presented conceptual model is its simplicity, considering 
the limited resources of the SME entities. Many quantitative multi-criteria meth-
ods directly or indirectly apply the idea of the SAW method, only the methods of 
dominant alternatives use values of specially selected functions (priorities, consen-
sus, and disagreement) instead of criteria normalized values. The validity of the 
342

method is also determined by the justification of the data required for the task based 
solely on quantitative measurements. The rules of the method can be summarized: 
these are the input data—the decision matrix and the significance of values of the 
indicators.
The choice of the AHP method was determined by its versatility and popularity, 
its ability to combine with TOPSIS and SAW (both methods belong to the group 
of combined methods, the main feature of which is the use of expert competence) 
evaluated by structured sequence of actions of using mathematical analysis methods.
