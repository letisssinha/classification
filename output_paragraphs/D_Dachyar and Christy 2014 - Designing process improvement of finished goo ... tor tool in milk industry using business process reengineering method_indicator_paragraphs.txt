Abstract. To maintain position as a major milk producer, the Indonesian milk industry should 
do some business development with the purpose of increasing customer service level. One 
strategy is to create on time release conditions for finished goods which will be distributed to 
customers and distributors. To achieve this condition, management information systems of 
finished goods on time release needs to be improved. The focus of this research is to conduct 
business process improvement using Business Process Reengineering (BPR). The deliverable 
key of this study is a comprehensive business strategy which is the solution of the root 
problems.  To achieve the goal, evaluation, reengineering, and improvement of the ERP system 
are conducted. To visualize the predicted implementation, a simulation model is built by Oracle 
BPM. The output of this simulation showed that the proposed solution could effectively reduce 
the process lead time and increase the number of quality releases. 
1. Introduction
Increasing number of baby birth has made many FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Good) 
companies for the baby willing to expand their market share by meeting the demand of baby products, 
one of the products is the baby milk. The demand for baby milk is increased by 6.6% (in volume) 
annually; from 37.300 tonnes in 2004 to 47.140 tons in 2008 [1]. 
Market growth, market competitive, and increased demand urged dairy industry to implement 
some strategies to maintain the position as a major dairy. One of the strategies is to increase customer 
service levels by increasing performance on quality releases – known as the finished good on time 
release. However, in one of multinational dairy companies its release has not been stable and on time. 
There is also no mapping of process information flow and no measurement for on time release 
process. 
In this strategy, quality division has the most important role. The performance of QFS (Quality 
Food Safety) Division is needed to be improved in order to achieve the strategy.

2. Literature Review
2.1.  Business Process Reengineering 
Business process reengineering (BPR) is a business management strategy that focuses on the analysis 
and design of material and information workflows and processes in an organization [2]. It 
recommended that the old process system should be removed and replaced with a new system which is 
more innovative and effective. 
There are several opinions about Business Process Reengineering.  BPR is radical rethinking and 
redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements modern measures of performance 
[3]. Business process reengineering introduces of new work strategies, actual process design, and 
implementation of the change in all its complex dimensions [4]. Reengineering process is a radical 
scrutiny, questioning, redefinition, and redesign of business processes with the aim of eliminating all 
activities not central to the process goals [2]. BPR is the methodology focused on the process and 
directly performed by the top management by performing the changes radical in order to make a better 
performance [5]. The four main reasons why companies need to develop business process 
reengineering are to fix and improve the customer service, to reduce cycle time by reducing non-added 
value activity, to reduce production costs and/or services, and to improve quality [3]. 
2.2.  BPR Methods 
Variuos methods of BPR have been introduced to facilitate the process of the reengineering. There 
are four methods that could be applied in the implementation of BPR [3].  Below are the list of BPR 
methods could be applied: 
 Mayer Method: Motivating reengineering, Justifying reengineering, Planning reengineering,
Setting up for reengineering, As-is description and validation, To-be design and validation, and
Implementation
 Feldman Method: Develop vision and strategy, Create desired culture, Integrate and improve
enterprise, and Develop technology solutions
 Harrison Method: Determine customer requirements and goals for the process, Map and measure
the existing process, Analyze and modify existing process, Design a reengineered process, and
Implement the reengineered process
 Muthu, Whitman, and Cheraghi Method: Prepare for Business Process Reengineering, Map and
Analyze As-Is Process, Design To-Be Process, Reengineered Process, and Improve Continuously.
2.3.  BPR Characteristic 
Four main characteristics of BPR [6] ; fundamental, radical, dramatic, and processes.  
Fundamental – The analysis is based on two aspects: “what” (focus on gaining the objectives of 
company) and “how” (focus on the order of activities in each process).  Radical – The method is 
undertaken by obtaining the root problem and ignoring all the structures and proce-dures that already 
exist to create a new process to be run. In some BPR approaches, existing systems may not be changed 
in radical way because of considering some factors such as the need to do change management, build 
an integrated system, project management, and select stakeholders. Dramatic – The purpose of BPR is 
to achieve the improved performance dramatically, so that the ambitious and aggressive goal can be 
created.  Processes – A process is a set of activities that requires a few input and produces an output 
that gives value to customer. 
2.4.  BPR Tools and Techniques 
There are several tools and techniques of BPR [7]. 

Process visualization ; The successful key of reengineering is based on the development of the
process’ vision.

Process mapping and modeling ; Process flowcharting, IDEF, role activity diagram, SIPOC
diagram, and others tools can be used to map and model the process.


Change management ; Human elements are needed to be combined with reengineering process
due to the big influence of human’s work and work method

Benchmarking ; This tool displays the process visually and its development in the operations of
other organizations.

Process and customer focus ; Main purpose of BPR is to redesign the process due to increase the
performance by customer’s perspective.

Problem solving and diagnosis : Pareto diagram, cognitive map, and other problems solving tools
can be used.

Process prototyping and simulation ; By doing simulation, BPR project team would be easier to
determine the process needed to be reengineered and the effects of its. Simulation provides the
structural visual model which is easier to be understood, analyzed, and improved.

Project management ; By this tool, budgeting, project scheduling, and others project indicator can
be known.

Process measurement ; Activity-based costing, statistic process control, and others measurement
can be used.
2.5.  Information Technology 
The use of information technology is one of factors that give a big contribution to the company. 
Information technology has an important role in business process reengineering [8]. The new 
technology allows the creation and redesign of business processes. By using technology, the modeling 
and simulation of systems and processes, will ease the implementation process. 
There are many situations that randomly affect the simulation so that simulations cannot be 
modeled by using others analytical technique. Simulation is the last tool that can be used when it is 
found that all methods of modeling cannot be done [8]. The technology is also needed in process 
mapping.  A simple process mapping simply cannot give an enough explanation and understanding to 
know what the things needed to be redesigned are though it is done by big project [8]. Process map 
helps project teams to understand the framework of existing problems.  However, the process should 
be supported by numerical analysis due to the team knows the things that need to be changed. 
Therefore, some programs and software can be used to make the process map and simulation of the as-
is model and to-be engineered.   
2.6.  Enterprise Resource Planning 
ERP systems have been considered as an important development in information technology in the 
company since the 1990s. By using the ERP system, all of the information that flows within a 
company can be integrated so that it will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
organizational cross-functional [3]. 
ERP is a cross-functional enterprise systems that integrate and automize a lot of company's internal 
business processes, especially in the fields of manufacturing, logistic, distribution, accounting, 
finance, and human resource. ERP helps companies to achieve efficiency, agility, and responsiveness 
that are necessary to be succeess in a dynamic business environment [3]. ERP software typically 
consists of integrated modules that give the appearance of a real-time cross-functional in a company’s 
core business process – such  as production, order processing, and sales – and  its resources – such as 
cash flow, raw materials, production capacity, and people. 
The lack of conformity between the strategy, structure, organization process, and the selection of 
the ERP application often give a problem or risk. ERP literature and business process reengineering 
indicate that ERP system could not be alone to increase company’s performance except the 
organization restructures the operational process. This is usually achieved through a business process 
reengineering [3].

3. Research Methodology
This research was conducted based on the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) method which has 
five steps such as Prepare for Business Process Reengineering, Map and analyze As-Is process, Design 
to-be process, Re-engineered process, and Improve Continuously. 
In the first step – Prepare for Engineering – the start preparation of BPR was done by identifying 
the company’s purpose or objective of the case and developing the strategies. In the second step – Map 
and Analyze As-Is Process – the flow of business processes related was mapped, then the investigation 
and evaluation of business processes were conducted. In the third step – Design To-Be Process – the 
best solutions and innovation for business process improvement was discussed.  In the fourth step – 
Reengineered Process – the draft and development of implementation plans. In the fifth step – 
Improve Continuously – the monitoring and controlling of the new system were being run so the new 
system’s performance can be evaluated and measured in order to make continuous improvement. 
Some scenarios would be performed to test the as-is and to-be process. To do simulation, Oracle BPM 
software is used. The two simulations were compared to see each performance. 
Data is collected by using secondary and primary data. Secondary data is data that is derived from 
QFS Division (Quality Food Safety) in the form of its historical record data of quality release or 
finished goods on time release process. Primary data is data that is gained by directly doing 
observation and interview with the supervisor, the staff of QFS Division, and operators. 
Secondary data is the record of 418 data. The variable note is time which is called as a lead time of 
quality releases or release time. The lead time is determined by the production order number, the date 
of quality release report, and the date of sample received. 
4. Analysis Result
4.1.  Step 1: Prepare for Engineering 
TIn the first study, general process understanding had to be drawn to understand the related supplier, 
input, process, output, and customer.  This study was using SIPOC Diagram. 
There are two subjects in this business process such as the supplier and customer.  The suppliers 
are the production planner and production division, while the customers are the production planner 
and the warehouse.  As supplier, the production planner gives production order needed while 
production division gives product sample which will be analyzed.  As customer, the production 
planner will receive quality report release while the warehouse will receive the product that will be 
distributed. 
There are also two objects in this business process such as input and output objects.  Input objects 
are production order (from the production planner) and product sample of finished goods (from 
production division).  Output object is the quality report release which is the main object of this 
business process.   
To produce output, several processes are needed.  The simple map of this process is shown in 
Figure 1.

4.2.  Step 2: Map and Analyze As-Is Process 
4.2.1.  Map As-Is Process. The main business process is Quality Process (Figure 2).  There are also 
some sub-processes which are Sampling Process, Sample Registration and Labeling, Disposition in 
SAP, Input and Reporting Data/Result Analysis, and Retest Process.  Table 1 shows the data of lead 
time of each process.

4.2.2.  Analyze As-Is Process.  
(a) Current condition 
Based on the secondary data, the average time of finished good on time release is 5.63 day. The 
percentage of on time release is 47.85% while the percentage of not on time release is 52.15%. The 
percentage of quality release weekly can be seen in Table 2. OTR is on time release, while NOT OTR 
is not on time release. 
(b) Problem identification 
Based on interview, some root problems that need to be improved, such as: 
1.
The information control is still conducted manually and inefficiently.
2.
The ERP system implemented is not integrated and not yet meets the quality release process.
3.
There is no notification information which automatically associated with quality releases.
4.
The business process of quality release and its approval process are still manually,
inefficiently, and ineffectively.
5.
There is no good quality releases management especially during the approval process.
6.
There is no performance measurement of the quality release process.
7.
There are some activities which is not value-added to the quality release process.
4.3.  Step 3: Design To-Be Process 
To provide some solutions for solving the problems, some strategies are implemented: 
1.
Create a business process redesign of quality release (Problem 4 and 7)
2.
Improve the existing SAP system to be more integrated and better so that it can meet the
quality release process (Problem 1 and 2)
3.

In this step, the strategies will be implemented. In the implementation step, there are also several 
phases which are needed for implementing the ERP system. There are seven phases at this step which 
are the initiation phase, evaluation, selection, modification, go-live, settlement, and exploitation and 
development phase.

4.5.  Step 5: Improve Continuously 
To be able to control the quality and system as well as make continuous improvements, monitoring 
and controlling the performance of the new system is necessary. This can be done by creating and 
using key performance indicator (KPI) tool, so that the performance of the system can be indicated. 
4.6.  Comparing Simulation of As-Is and To-Be Process 
To find out the effectiveness of the new system, simulation of as-is and to-be processes are conducted 
to compare both processes. These simulations are run by software. These simulations use some 
assumptions based on interviews and primary data captured through direct observation. Visual 
simulation of as-is and to-be process can be shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. 
The simulation was conducted on two processes which are as-is and to-be processes process. On 
the to-be process, six scenarios are conducted (Table 3). Simulated results can be seen in Table 4.

5. Discussion
The current condition shows that the process of quality releases or finished good on time release has 
not been run well. This is shown by the performance of quality release which the percentage of not on 
time quality release is 47.85%. In addition, the weekly percentage of quality release is also not 
consistent or always up and down. For example from the first week to the fourth week, the percentage 
of quality release was increasing, but after that the decreasing were happening drastically. 
Besides the observation data, there were also several interviews conducted. Based on the results of 
observation and interview, the roots of the problem were found: 
1.
The information control is still done manually and not efficient. Operators still use manual
way to control the information in ERP system, for example checking the system one by one.
This condition certainly will reduce the performance of the operator for doing the work.
2.
The implemented ERP system has not been run integratedly and has not met the needs of
quality release process. The use of the existing system is not optimal. Ms. Excel is still used to
process the information. This condition certainly does not support the quality release process
even to make it more effective, efficient, and optimal.
3.
There are some activities in the business process which does not give added-value on the
quality release. Therefore, it is needed to redesign the business process to improve
performance.
4.
The management of quality release is still not good especially during the approval process. For
example, the management of approval process still takes a long time because of the waiting
activity.

There is no measurement applied to measure the performance of the quality release process.
Although the QFS has tools and indicators to measure the others performance, in fact there is
no indicator to measure the performance of the quality release process.
In order to improve the performance of quality release process, five strategies have been designed five 
strategies, such as: 
•
Design new business process flow : In this strategy, there is one activity omitted which is the
request activity of approval by QFS Manager. Besides, it is also reengineering on two
activities which are sample taking process from production line and sample delivery to
laboratory.
•
Improve the ERP systems : The new ERP system should be designed to meet the needs of
process quality release. Some functions needed are the report description, product description,
stock overview, and analysis report.
•
Make the system notification system : Automatic notification system needed to be installed is
a system that will give a pop-up notification when there is notification information in
computer. The necessary notification are the notification of data input in folder share, the
notification of new quality report in the ERP system, the notification of needing retest, the
notification of release or reject or retest product, and the notification if the approval process
over the time limit.
•
Design new policy for quality releases : This policy should be made by the director and aim to
support the necessary requirements to implement the strategies which have been designed
above.
•
Design new performance indicator tool : Performance indicator tool can be created by using
Ms. Excel. Some of the contents are (1) Measurement for Week 1-26 and 28-Week 52, KPI
Graphic (2), (3) Consistency of On Time Release (OTR), and (4) the Lead Time Variability of
Difference.
To show a comparison between the as-is process and to-be process, some simulations have already 
been conducted with several scenarios. Simulations focusing on lead time are necessary for processing 
the quality release. As a simulation, to-be process assessed much better compared to the as-is process. 
This can be proved by these points below: 
•
Number of completed instances : Completed instance is an operated entity in the quality
release process from the early stage to the completed stage. In this case the operated entity is
quality release. As the as-is process, the number of completed instances is 125. As the to-be
process, the number of completed instances is 130 to 143. By implementing the to-be process,
ScieTech 2014

doi:10.1088/1742-6596/495/1/012011
9
the number of quality release is increased by as much as 5 to 18. This shows that the to-be 
process is more effective and efficient than the as-is process. 
•
Average process time : Average lead time used to complete a quality release is the main focus
in this research. On the as-is process, the process time used was 777.106 seconds. On the to-be
process, as the optimum result of six scenarios, it was found that process time of quality
release was 473.164 seconds. Process time has been declined by 43.74%. This shows that the
to-be process is more effective and efficient than the as-is process.
•
Number of retest and reject product : The greater the probability of retest and reject product,
the amount of products released become less. This shows that, in order to increase the number
of quality report which passes the test quality, the number of retest and reject has to be
suppressed by improving the performance of the production process and the process of
analysis in the laboratory.
In each scenario, the number of completed instances and the average process time was different. This 
is because of the difference scenario of retest and rejected probability. If the retest and rejected 
probability is smaller, the number of completed instances will be higher and the average processing 
time will be shorter. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the research that has been conducted, there are some findings. The as-is process is 
ineffective and inefficient. As an analysis result, some of the root problems are the control of 
information is still conducted manually, the ERP system that is used is not integrated and does not 
meet the requirements of the process, there are some non-added-value activities in quality release 
process, the management of quality release is still not good, and there is no measurement applied to 
measure the performance and set the standard for doing improvement. 
The to-be process is included the business process redesign of quality release process, 
implementation of ERP system to fit the needs of a new business process, implementation of the 
automatic notification information, creating policy related management process in quality release, and 
designing performance indicator tool as a reference to see the performance of the process so that it can 
always make improvement. 
By the six scenarios, the best condition in the quality release process is on the first scenario. In this 
scenario, the process runs with the lowest retest and rejected probability which is 0% and 10%. As a 
result, the process time is reduced by 43.74% and the number of quality release is increased by 18 
quality release. This scenario shows that these strategies can improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of process quality release. Nevertheless, this scenario is supported by the condition of the good and 
qualified production process as well as a good performance during the test analysis in the laboratory.
