Izhodišča: V zdravstvenih procesih v bolnišni-
cah, kot tudi v procesih v podjetjih ali v državnih 
organizacijah, se lahko s časom nakopičjo pro-
blemi in ovire, ki povzročajo, da procesi posta-
nejo neučinkoviti. Business Process Management 
(BPM) je postopek za modeliranje, izboljšanje in 
avtomatizacijo procesov, ki se uporablja z veli-
kim uspehom za izboljšanje procesov.
Metode: Namen tega raziskovalnega dela je pre-
učiti možnosti izvedbe izboljšanja zdravstvenega 
procesa z uporabo BPM. Za uporabo ideje po-
stopka BPM je bilo potrebno razviti nov koncept 
metodologije Tabular Application Development 
(TAD).To predstavlja pomemben prispevek na 
področju managementa procesov v teoriji in 
praksi. V članku so predstavljene prve tri faze 
metodologije TAD tako, da je vsak korak teh faz 
obrazložen in nato izpeljan. Prva faza se ukvar-
ja z identifikacijo procesov, druga razvija model 
“kot-je” z uporabo tehnike tabele aktivnosti, tre-
tja faza pa obravnava izboljšanje procesa z razvo-
jem modela “naj-bo”.
Rezultati: Ugotovili smo: (a) postopek “izvedba 
operacije” je učinkovit in dobro organiziran; (b) 
možno je skrajšati čas okrevanja bolnikov, ven-
dar zaradi človeških in socialnih razlogov vod-
stvo raje pusti čas okrevanja, kot je; (c) proces je 
povezan z nekaterimi zamudnimi aktivnostmi, 
ki se izvajajo v drugih oddelkih in predstavljajo 
ozko grlo procesa.
Sklepi: Ugotovljeno je bilo: (a) BPM je prime-
ren postopek za izvedbo izboljšanja zdravstvenih 
procesov; (b) prenovljena metodologija TAD 
se je pokazala kot učinkovita pri izvedbi iden-
tifikacije, modeliranju in izboljšanju procesov; 
(c) proces “Izvedba operacije” je učinkovit in ne 
potrebuje izboljšanj; (d) glede zamudnih aktiv-
nosti se je vodstvo klinike odločilo obravnavati 
ta problem z vodstvi oddelkov, kjer se aktivnosti 
izvajajo.
Abstract
Background: Healthcare processes in hospitals, 
likewise processes in companies or governmen-
tal organizations, may accumulate problems and 
obstacles over time, which consequently cause 
the processes to become ineffective. BPM (Busi-
ness Process Management) is an approach to pro-
cess modeling, improvement and automating, 
which has been used with great success for pro-
cess improvement.
Methods: This work was to examine the possi-
bility of improving healthcare process by using 
BPM. To implement BPM ideas, a revised TAD 
(Tabular Application Development) methodology 
was developed, representing an important con-
tribution to BPM. The first three phases of the 
TAD methodology were introduced in a step-by-
step approach. The first phase deals with process 
identification, the second develops the “as-is” 
model, and the third phase discusses process im-
provement by developing a “to-be” model.
Results: We found that (a) the Surgery process 
is efficient and well organized; (b) patient stay in 
the Department could be shortened; however for 
humane and social reasons the leadership prefers 
to leave the residence time as it is; (c) the pro-
cess is associated with some time-consuming ac-
tivities that are performed by other departments 
and represent the bottleneck of the process.
Conclusions: (a) BPM proved to be a suitable 
approach to implementing healthcare process 
improvement; (b) the revised TAD methodol-
ogy was found to be consistent and efficient in 
performing BPM approach; (c) the Surgery pro-
cess was found to be effective and no changes or 
improvements are needed; (d) concerning time-

consuming activities, the leadership decided to 
discuss this problem with the management of 
the departments where the activities are carried 
out.
1  Introduction
Throughout the last years, the field of 
BPM has been gaining recognition and 
acceptance. This field includes process mo-
deling, improvement and automating. BPM 
is the discipline of modeling, automating, 
managing and optimizing business proces-
ses throughout their lifecycle to increase 
profitability.1 BPM is based on the fact that 
a business process is the key element of the 
organization.
The process is comprehended as a trans-
formation of inputs to outputs.2 We are fo-
cusing on processes regardless of the organi-
zational form of the research institutions.3-5 
It is the business processes that are the key 
element when integrating an enterprise.6
The aim of this paper is to show the 
possibility of using the BPM approach to 
improve healthcare processes in hospitals. 
The paper focuses on modeling and impro-
vement of a healthcare process using the 
revised TAD methodology. Evaluation of a 
patient’s health status is an essential part of 
the healthcare process.7
The paper is divided into 4 sections. In 
Section 2, TAD methodology is discussed. 
Section 3 represents the results of this work. 
Section 4 introduces some conclusions. 
Throughout the paper, the healthcare pro-
cess of carrying out surgery in the Depart-
ment of Abdominal Surgery of the Univer-
sity Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia, is 
illustrated.
2  TAD Methodology
TAD methodology consists of five pha-
ses;8 these are process identification, process 
modeling, process improvement and in-
novation, system development, and system 
maintenance. Due to space limitations, the 
last two phases that deal with process mana-
gement system, are not considered.
2.1 Phase 1 – Process identification
The first phase of TAD methodology de-
als with identifying the organization’s pro-
cesses starting with core processes, where we 
do not differentiate between profit or non-
-profit organizations. The expected number 
of core or major processes that pass through 
different functional areas of an organization 
may be between 10 and 20.9
These are horizontal processes that link 
together the various functional activities 
that deliver the output of the enterprise.10 
Business process is a collection of activities 
that takes one or more kinds of input and 
creates an output that is of value to the cu-
stomer.11
In this phase, a number of interviews are 
organized with the management at the stra-
tegic, business and operational levels. The 
purpose of the interviews with strategic ma-
nagement is to understand to gain informa-
tion about the strategic goals of the manage-
ment and information about the structure of 
the organization.
Interviews are continued with manage-
ment at the business level. The purpose of 
these interviews is to identify the processes 
of the organization. The result of these in-
terviews is a list of processes, information 
about the departments through which each 
process passes and plan of interviews with 
responsible people at departmental level.
The aim of organizing interviews at ope-
rational level is to define the flow of each 
process identified through various functio-
nal areas (departments).
Surgery Process: During interviews with 
the management of the Department of Ab-
dominal Surgery one process was selected, 
i.e. Surgery. This process is carried out in the 
following three departments: the Outpatient 
Service, the Emergency Unit and the De-
partment of Abdominal Surgery.

2.2 Phase 2 – Process modeling
The second phase of TAD methodology 
deals with developing a process model for 
each process selected in the previous phase.
Conceptual modeling of business pro-
cesses is deployed on a large scale to faci-
litate the development of software that su-
pports the business processes, and to permit 
the analysis and re-engineering or improve-
ment of them.12 Furthermore, business pro-
cess modeling is one of the requirements of 
ISO 9000 international standard for quality 
management and assurance.13
To sufficiently define a process, firstly the 
process activities and their resources need 
to be identified, and then the sequence order 
of the identified activities needs to be esta-
blished. A process model is a logical repre-
sentation of a real process that describes its 
functioning and interactions with its enviro-
nment. A process model consists of a set of 
activities and execution constraints between 
them.14
Developing a successful process model 
depends on appropriate selection of availa-
ble modeling techniques. For this purpose, 
in this work a special modeling technique 
called the “Activity Table” is used.
In order to develop a process model that 
represents a true likeness of the existing re-
ality of the process, the state of the art of the 
process should be first discovered and un-
derstood.
In this phase, the Activity Table, which 
represents process model, is developed. This 
table consists of two parts. The second part 
provides information about each activity of 
the process.
2.2.1 Activity Table Development – Part 1
The first part of the table is a tabular-
-graphical representation of the process di-
scussed. To develop the activity table, infor-
mation about process functioning should be 
gained during interviews that are organized 
with experienced employees in different de-
partments. The activity table of the process 
selected represents its “as-is” model. This 
sub-phase has three steps.
First Step
In this step, the name of the process is 
written in the first column of the first part of 
the Activity Table, see Table 1. If the process 
is large and complex, then it may be partiti-
oned into a set of sub-processes, which are 
in this case listed in the second column of 
the table.
Second Step
Each business process consists of a num-
ber of work processes. Therefore, in the 
“Work Process” column of the table (usually 
the second column), all work processes of 
the process are indicated.
For each work process listed, in the first 
row of the table, the name of the department 
to which the work process belongs should be 
written, see Table 1.
Third Step
A work process is a process that consists 
of a set of activities performed within a cer-
tain department. This step deals with iden-
tifying the activities performed within each 
of the work processes listed in the previous 
step.
An activity is a micro-process that re-
presents well-defined work performed by 
one resource.15 An activity may consist of a 
number of tasks.
To identify the activities, further inter-
views are organized with the employees in-
volved in performing them. To do this, the 
following procedure is used:
•	 identify all activities that are performed 
within the framework of each work pro-
cess;
•	 for each activity identified
•	 define the activity in the Activity co-
lumn;
•	 indicate the resource that performs 
the activity in a certain column of 
the second row of the Activity Table 
under the department in which it is 
employed;
•	 connect the activity to its predeces-
sor activity or activities by vertical 
arrow(s);
•	 if the activity consists of tasks, then 
list them in the next Task column and 
use similar rules as in the previous 
three to connect them.

The Activity Table technique uses a small 
set of flowchart symbols to model a process, 
such as: ○, 
, □, ◊, │, →, ←, ↓, ↑. These 
symbols have the following meanings:
•	 symbol ○ indicates the starting point of 
a process;
•	 symbol 
 indicates the end point of a 
process or a certain path;
•	 symbol □ in cell(i,j) means that 
resource(j) performs activity(i), where j 
ranges from 1 to the number of resour-
ces and i ranges from 1 to the number of 
activities;
•	 symbol ◊ in cell(i,j) means that activity(i) 
is a decision activity;
•	 symbol │ is used to fork outputs of an 
activity or merge inputs of different ac-
tivities;
•	 horizontal arrows →, ← are used to con-
nect the activities horizontally;
•	 vertical arrows ↓, ↑ are used to link the 
activities vertically;
•	 symbol * in cell(i,j) and cell(i,k) mean 
that activity(i) could be performed by 
resource(j) or resource(k).
Surgery Process: Table 1 introduces the 
Activity Table – Part 1 of the Surgery process. 
This table represents the process’s “as-is” mo-
del. As Table 1 shows, the process comprises 
7 work processes, 54 activities, and 13 reso-
urces that belong to 3 departments, and 2 
external resources.
2.2.2 Activity Table Development – Part 2
Simultaneously with Part 1, Part 2 of the 
Activity Table is developed. The purpose of 
this part is to describe the process model 
introduced in Part 1 by providing detailed 
information of its activities. In the current 
sub-phase a number of parameters that de-
scribe the activities are defined.
Activity Parameters
In the columns of the Activity Table – 
Part 2 the following parameters are defined 
for each activity(i), where i ranges from 1 to 
the number of activities.
•	 Description. A short and precise descrip-
tion of what exactly is the work carried 
out by the activity defined in row(i) of 
the table.
•	 Time. The expected duration needed for 
activity(i) to be processed and accompli-
shed.
•	 Rule. One or more constraints or rules 
that must be met in order for activity(i) 
to be performed.
•	 Input/Ouput. Input(s) and ouput(s) of 
activity(i) .
Surgery Process: Table 2 shows the Activi-
ty Table – Part 2 of the Surgery process. Due 
to space limitations, only the activities of the 
first work process are shown.
2.3 Phase 3 – Process 
improvement and innovation
This is the key phase in process manage-
ment. It is closely connected with customer 
satisfaction. When the customer is satisfied 
with the desired output of the organizati-
on, then there is probably no need for im-
plementing changes in the organization. 
Otherwise, when the organization discovers 
the customers’ dissatisfaction, then the busi-
ness processes need to be improved or inno-
vated as soon as possible.
Process improvement is a complex task 
that may function only if it is continuously 
planned and implemented. Continuous bu-
siness process improvement should result in 
a 10–15 % yearly ongoing improvement in 
the process.16
Process improvement is done on the ba-
sis of a precise analysis of the “as-is” process 
model, which consequently leads to develo-
ping a “to-be” process model that is imple-
mented in the end instead of the old process.
2.3.1 “as-is” Process Analysis
The aim of this sub-phase is to examine 
the behavior of the “as-is” model and identi-
fy its existing problems. If making changes 
in the process functioning solves the pro-
blems found, then the process improvement 
is the approach used. Otherwise, if the pro-
cess requires radical changes, then process 
innovation is the right solution. This sub-
-phase consists of four steps.

blems that lead to its inefficiency and con-

sequently the creation of queues within it. 
An effective way to discover its real func-
tioning is to use the simulation technique. 
Furthermore, conducting a precise analysis 
of the simulation results enables us to iden-
tify problems and obstacles in the process.
A simulation is the imitation of the ope-
ration of a real-world process or system over 
time. A discrete system is one in which the 
state variable(s) changes only at discrete set 
of points in time.17
Simulation is a technique that enables us 
to imitate a real process by developing its 
model whose attributes are the same as the 
attributes of the original. For this purpose, 
real input data is used in conducting expe-
rimentation on the overtime behavior of the 
process.

lation model of the Surgery process, which 
was created on the basis of the “as-is” process 
model given in Table 1. The simulation of the

process was run taking into consideration 
the following assumptions.
•	 Outpatient service
•	 1 patient enters the abdominal surgi-
cal infirmary every 25 minutes;
•	 79 % of patients are registered for a 
first medical examination;
•	 21 % of patients have a medical con-
trol after surgery;
•	 90 % of the patients who have the first 
medical examination are scheduled 
for surgery;
•	 the resources in this infirmary are 1 
administrator, 1 nurse, 1 anesthetist, 
another department, and 2 surgeons;
•	 waiting for surgery is defined by the 
function TriangleDist(1, 14, 10), whi-
ch means the minimum wait is 1, the 
maximum 14, and the most likely 10 
days.
•	 Emergency Unit
•	 1 patient enters the abdominal surgi-
cal infirmary every 60 minutes;
•	 25 % of these patients are sent to the 
Department to carry out urgent sur-
gery;
•	 the resources in this infirmary are 1 
administrator, 1 nurse, another de-
partment, and 1 surgeon;
•	 Department of Abdominal Surgery
•	 patients are sent to the Department 
either from the Outpatient Service or 
Emergency Unit;
•	 the capacity of the Department is 75 
beds and most of the time it is com-
pletely occupied;
•	 the number of patients hospitalized 
daily is equal to the number of pati-
ents that are discharged;
•	 prior to surgery, every patient needs 1 
day for internal cleansing and possi-
bly 1 day for additional medical tests;
•	 seven resources are defined in the De-
partment, these are 6 nurses, 6 nurses 
in Intensive Care, 2 head nurses, 8 
surgeons, 1 anesthetist, and 1 admini-
strator;
•	 recovery in Intensive Care is defined 
by the function TriangleDist(3, 5, 4), 
which means that the minimum stay 
is 3, the maximum 5, and the most li-
kely 4 days; and
•	 recovery in the Department is defined 
by the function TriangleDist(4, 8, 5), 
which means the minimum stay is 4, 
the maximum 8, and the most likely 
5 days.
Many interesting simulation results were 
obtained after running this simulation, Ta-
ble 3 shows some of them.
Process Flow
Process flow starts when a flow unit 
(job or transaction) enters a process from 
its environment, continues throughout the 
process’s activities and buffers, and ends 
when it leaves the process as its output. The 
flow unit on its way through the process 
may join other flow units at the end of one 
or more queues waiting to be processed by 
the process’s activities.
To calculate the process flow, three key 
measures are used:18
•	 the average flow time or cycle time (T) 
is the average of flow times (cycle times) 
across all flow units that exit the process 
during a specific time span;
•	 the average inventory (I) is the number 
of flow units within the process bounda-
ries at any point in time; and
•	 the average flow rate (R) is the average 
number of flow units that flow through 
(into and out of) the process per unit of 
time.

Process flow is defined by the listed vari-
ables, which are calculated using Little’s law; 
see formula 1. Little’s law defines the impor-
tant relationship between average inventory, 
average flow rate and average cycle time in a 
stable process.

Surgery Process: Our main task was to ca-
rry out process improvement in the Depart-
ment. In addition to the simulation results 
shown in Table 3, the rest of the calculated 
process performance measures of the Surge-
ry process are shown below.
From the assumptions given in the pre-
vious section, we know that the average 
inventory is 75; this is the number of pati-
ents in the Department at any point of time.

Furthermore, the simulation results showed 
that the average cycle time in the Depart-
ment is 12.05 days, the minimal cycle time is 
7.93, and the maximal is 15.04 days. Therefo-
re, the flow rate (throughput) of the process 
is calculated using Little’s law as follows:
Average R = 75 / 12.05 = 6.22 patients/day
This result means that 6 patients per day 
enter the process and the same number of 
patients leaves it.
Cycle Time Efficiency
A flow unit on its way from the start to the 
end of a process goes through a sequence of 
activities and buffers. Thus the cycle time of 
a flow unit within a process actually consists 
of the times spent within the process’s acti-
vities and the waiting times spent in buffers.
In order to calculate the cycle time effi-
ciency, we first need to understand the mea-
ning of term theoretical cycle time. Theore-
tical cycle time of a process is the minimum 
amount of time required for processing a 
typical flow unit without any waiting.18 The 
cycle-time efficiency is the ratio between 
the theoretical cycle time and the average 
cycle time. This ratio enables us to evaluate 
the waiting time in the process, which indi-
cates the possibility of carrying out process 
improvement by reducing the waiting time 
in it.
Cycle Time Efficiency =  
Theoretical Cycle Time / Average Cycle Time 
	
(2)
Surgery Process: The simulation results 
show that the average theoretical cycle time 
is equal to 1.36 days. Using formula 2 yields:
Cycle time efficiency =  
1.36/12.05 = 11.29 %
This result means that the patient waiting 
time is 88.71 % of the average cycle time of 
the process. This is an expected result beca-
use by waiting time we may understand a 
patient’s waiting and recovery time.
Process Capacity
The capacity of a process depends on the 
process resources that perform its activities. 
In order to understand the process capacity, 
let us define the following terms:
A resource pool is a group of resources 
that perform similar kinds of activities. Each 
member of a resource pool represents a unit 
of this pool.
The unit load of a resource is the sum 
of the times of the activities performed by 
a certain resource unit in processing a flow 
unit through the whole process.
Capacity utilization measures the degree 
to which resources are effectively utilized by 
a process. Capacity utilization is defined for 
each resource pool.
Surgery Process: Table 4 shows the capa-
city utilization of each resource pool. The-
se values are obtained from the simulation 
results and apply to the resources’ capacity 
utilization in this process only.
2.3.2 “to-be” Process Model Creation
Improvement of the existing “as-is” pro-
cess is done depending on the problems 
identified by analyzing the simulation re-
sults and the calculated process performan-
ce measures. A number of different possibi-
lities should be studied in order to improve 
the process, such as removing work proces-
ses that fit within other processes, minimi-
zing the waiting times, shortening the times 
of time-consuming activities, and reducing 
the number of repetition loops.
3  Results
Analyzing the simulation results enabled 
us to identify the following difficulties or 
problems:
a.	 a time consuming activity in the Outpa-
tient Service that causes days of waiting, 
this is the activity “Get Medical Findings”, 
which is indicated by 6 and 16;
b.	 the same activity in the Emergency Unit, 
which is indicated by 22, causes hours of 
delay;
c.	 in the Department we found that the 
cycle time of the patient’s stay in the De-
partment is relatively long, between 7.93

and 15.04 days, with an average stay of 
12.05 days.
In order to find ideas for improvement 
of the “as-is” Surgery process, we did the fol-
lowing:
•	 Firstly, we carefully analyzed Table 1. The 
result of this analysis was that no redun-
dant work processes or activities exist in 
the Surgery process and also there are no 
activities whose duration could be shor-
tened.
•	 Secondly, we tried to find solutions for 
the above given three problems:
•	 concerning problem (a), activities 
6 and 16 are performed in other de-
partments of the hospital Institute of 
Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, 
Institute of Radiology, etc. and there-
fore these activities were not accessi-
ble to our team;
•	 the same conclusion is valid for pro-
blem (b);
•	 problem (c) of the relatively long stay 
of patients; it was found that the reco-
very time could be shortened by a few 
days but the leadership prefers not to 
do so because:
•	 most of these patient are old peo-
ple and have nobody to take care 
of them;
•	 the majority of them have diffe-
rent kinds of abdominal cancer 
and therefore they need longer re-
covery times.
4  Conclusions
There are a number of techniques that 
are used to carry out process modeling, such 
as the Flowchart and UML (Unified Mode-
ling Language).
A flowchart is commonly used to show 
the flow of a process. It usually consists of 
different symbols connected by lines. The di-
sadvantage of this technique lays in its flexi-
bility as it allows each modeler to unite va-
rious parts of the process together to obtain 
the whole picture as she/he feels they fit best. 
In addition, the technique does not have any 
mechanism for discovering gaps or defici-
encies existing in the model developed. For 
this reason we agree with those researchers

who argue that the flowchart technique is 
too flexible.19
UML uses 14 types of diagrams (7 struc-
ture diagrams and 7 behavior diagrams), 
which makes the modeling process difficult 
to manage. The purpose of UML is to deve-
lop software systems.
Meanwhile, the activity table modeling 
technique of TAD methodology is less flexi-
ble as it allows the modeler to define the bu-
siness process activities only in connection 
with resources. In addition, it has a mecha-
nism to discover gaps or deficiencies exi-
sting in the table. This is achieved by using 
the vertical linkage to put the activities in a 
determined order.
Furthermore, the purpose of TAD me-
thodology is to implement the process ma-
nagement approach, which includes process 
modeling, improvement and system deve-
lopment.
Implementing the first three phases of 
TAD methodology enabled us to uncover a 
number of findings, such as:
a.	 BPM is an approach that has proved to 
be an important way to carry out healt-
hcare process improvement and is capa-
ble of keeping processes in hospitals as 
effective as possible.
b.	 There is no process owner recognized in 
the hospital, and this role is carried out 
by the leaderships of the departments. 
Because the healthcare process may pass 
across different departments, we suggest 
that the leadership of the hospital deter-
mines a process owner for each healt-
hcare process. The process owner is the 
person responsible for the process, solves 
its problems and obstacles, and takes care 
for continuous process improvement.
c.	 The proposed concept of TAD metho-
dology was shown to be a consistent and 
efficient approach that implements pro-
cess identification, modeling and impro-
vement in an easy manner, particularly 
after extending it by the use of the simu-
lation technique and process performan-
ce measures.
d.	 The healthcare process discussed was 
found to be effective and the patients 
as well as the leadership of the Depart-
ment are satisfied with it. Nevertheless, 
there are possibilities for further impro-
vements such as shortening the patient’s 
stay in the Department.
e.	 The Surgery process is associated with 
some time-consuming activities, whi-
ch are performed in other departments. 
Therefore, the Department has no influ-
ence on accelerating their performance.
