ISO9001:2000. The international standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when 
developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a QMS to enhance customer 
satisfaction by meeting customer requirement. The advantage of process approach is to link 
all parties in scope of business of the organization from suppliers, internal departments of 
organization to gather to make B2B communication and integration. In this paper, the process 
approach is defined based on QMS requirement. Supply department was proposed for 
implementation of process. Purchasing process was designed as a linkage between supplier
