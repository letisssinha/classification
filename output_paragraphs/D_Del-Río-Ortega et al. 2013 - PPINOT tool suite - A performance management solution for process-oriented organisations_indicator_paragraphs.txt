Abstract. A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the mea-
surement of process performance for the achievement of its strategic
and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key
asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, the management of
these PPIs throughout the whole BP lifecycle is crucial. In this demo
we present PPINOT Tool Suite, a set of tools aimed at facilitating and
automating the PPI management. The support includes their deÔ¨Ånition
using either a graphical or a template-based textual notation, their auto-
mated analysis at design-time, and their automated computation based
on the instrumentation of a Business Process Management System.

DeÔ¨Åning and Analysing PPIs with PPINOT
Performance requirements on business processes (BPs) are usually speciÔ¨Åed in
terms of Process Performance Indicators (PPIs), which are quantiÔ¨Åable metrics
that can be measured directly by data that is generated within the process Ô¨Çow
and are aimed at evaluating the eÔ¨Éciency and eÔ¨Äectiveness of business process.
The management of those PPIs is, thus, an important part of the BP lifecycle
that includes at least the deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs, their analysis to Ô¨Ånd relationships
between them, the instrumentation of the information systems that support the
BPs in order to take the measures that are necessary to calculate the PPIs, the
actual calculation of the PPIs during process execution, and the monitoring of
the PPIs fulÔ¨Ållment.
The PPINOT Metamodel [1] provides a foundation on which an automated
support for these activities can be built. It identiÔ¨Åes the concepts that are nec-
essary for deÔ¨Åning Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) such as the diÔ¨Äerent
types of measures that can be used to compute the PPI value. It was deÔ¨Åned
to address the challenge of providing PPI deÔ¨Ånitions that are unambiguous and

complete, traceable to the business process elements used in their deÔ¨Ånition, in-
dependent of the language used to model business processes (BP) and amenable
to automated analysis.
Two notations have been developed on top of the PPINOT Metamodel, namely
a graphical notation and a template-based textual notation [2]. The former ex-
tends BPMN to allow the graphical deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs together with their cor-
responding BPs. The latter provides a template for PPIs and a set of linguistic
patterns the user must follow to make the PPI deÔ¨Ånition easier [2]. Figure 1 shows
an example of a PPI deÔ¨Åned using PPINOT. The left hand side corresponds to
a template-based deÔ¨Ånition, the right hand side depicts the corresponding XML
serialisation of the PPINOT Metamodel.

The PPINOT Metamodel is also provided with formal semantics based on
Description Logics (DL). This enables leveraging reasoning operations imple-
mented by oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf DL reasoners to automatically extract information from
the relationships between PPIs and BP elements. This information can be used
to assist process analysts in the deÔ¨Ånition and instrumentation of PPIs [1].
In this paper, we give an overview of the PPINOT Tool Suite, which is a set
of tools based on the PPINOT Metamodel that automate or facilitate some of
the aforementioned PPI management activities.

PPINOT Tool Suite Overview
Figure 2 overviews the tools that compose the PPINOT Tool Suite. Rectangles
depict tools, their inputs and outputs are represented by documents linked with
dashed arrows, and the possible interconnections between tools is done by using
solid arrows. The tools can be used separately or sequentially, depending on the
user purposes. In the following we describe a possible way to use it.
Design. The PPINOT Tool Suite oÔ¨Äers two diÔ¨Äerent ways to deÔ¨Åne PPIs. On
the one hand, we can deÔ¨Åne them graphically together with the BPMN repre-
sentation of the BP using the PPINOT Graphical Editor, which is a web editor
that has been implemented as an extension of the Oryx platform [3]. On the
other hand, we can use the PPINOT Templates Editor to deÔ¨Åne PPIs using the
template-based textual notation. The tool guides the user by providing linguis-
tic patterns according to the selection performed in the diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åelds. In both

cases, an XML document with the PPI information together with the BP model
is obtained as output.
Analysis. After deÔ¨Åning the PPIs, the PPINOT Analyser can be used. It uses the
DL formalisation of PPINOT metamodel to implement the analysis operations
that obtain information about the way PPIs and BP elements inÔ¨Çuence each
other. Concretely, two kinds of analysis operations are currently supported: (I)
BPElements involved, which allows answering the question Given a PPI, Which
are the process model‚Äôs elements involved?. This information is useful for instance
when a PPI must be replaced with others (maybe because it is very costly to
obtain its value) and it is necessary to assure that every element of the BP that
was measured before is measured in the new case; and (II) PPIs associated to
BPElement, which allows answering the question Given a BPElement, Which
are the PPIs associated or applied to it?. This information can assist during the
evolution of BPs (e.g., an activity is deleted) to identify which PPIs will be
aÔ¨Äected and should be updated.
Execution. The last set of tools that can be used are those focused on the
execution of the BP. Before execution, the PPINOT Instrumenter conÔ¨Ågures
Activiti (an open source BPMS1) to send events to a Complex Event Processor
(CEP) and also conÔ¨Ågures the CEP to compute the values of the deÔ¨Åned PPIs
from the events generated by Activiti during BP execution. The computed values
of the PPIs are stored in a PPI Database. Finally, the PPINOT Reporter can
be used to present the user these values2.

provide a proper report is planned.

SigniÔ¨Åcance and Features
PPINOT Tool Suite has been developed from research results, and validated and
extended thanks to the feedback obtained from several real scenarios, both from
organisations and academia. To the best of our knowledge, there not exists any
similar tool for the deÔ¨Ånition and design-time analysis of PPIs. Concretely, we
can highlight the following features, from which the last four provide the novelty
to our proposal:
BPMN 2.0 compliant. PPIs can be deÔ¨Åned over BP diagrams (BPDs) pre-
viously modelled using the de facto standard BPMN 2.0.
PPI values computation Taking as starting point any of the aforementioned
PPI deÔ¨Ånitions, PPINOT also provides the possibility to extract the infor-
mation required to calculate PPI values from Activiti, an open source BP
management platform, and to create reports with these values.
Graphical deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs. PPINOT Tool Suite supports the graphical
deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs using a graph-based graphical notation that is easily un-
derstandable by non-technical users, at the same time that it is supported
by a metamodel that assures the precise and complete deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs.
Template-based deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs. PPIs can be deÔ¨Åned by fulÔ¨Ålling tem-
plates written in structured natural language, where the user only has to
properly introduce the missing information, assisted by linguistic patterns.
PPI deÔ¨Ånition mapping Graphical deÔ¨Ånition of PPIs can be mapped to their
corresponding templates in natural language.
Automated analysis of PPIs. The aforementioned analysis operations can
be automatically performed on PPI deÔ¨Ånitions.
