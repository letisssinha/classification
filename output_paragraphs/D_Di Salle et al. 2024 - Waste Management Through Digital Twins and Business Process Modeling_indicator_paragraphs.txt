Abstract
Littering is an environmental problem that affects citizens’ econ-
omy, safety, and health. Natural and rural areas are often targets
of abandoned littering, while urban areas often accumulate more
waste than can be disposed of in a timely manner. Minimizing lit-
tering and waste is a critical sustainability challenge requiring the
cooperation of different professionals and agencies. In this paper,
we report our vision and preliminary proposal for a model-driven
approach to address the automated localization and identification
of abandoned waste. Our solution envisages the usage of digital
process twins to enable the specification of cost-effective and self-
adaptive procedures fed by data crowdsourced from the real world.

Introduction
Littering is an environmental problem that affects citizens’ econ-
omy, safety, and health. In fact, abandoned waste can cause fire
hazards, pollution, flooding, and poisoning of wildlife and animal
food sources. Natural areas, which are considered tremendous as-
sets for some regions because they are silent and isolated, are often
targets of littering. Cleaning urban and wild areas is extremely
expensive. For instance, the Clean Europe Network estimates that
the total cost of cleaning up litter on the land throughout the EU is
in the range of €10-13 billion [10].
Minimizing littering and waste is a critical sustainability chal-
lenge that requires the cooperation of different professionals and
agencies. In this paper, we report our vision for a model-driven
approach to address the automated localization and identification of
abandoned waste and the cost-effective management of its disposal.
Previous approaches were not entirely successful because they
required too much effort from the community, e.g., due to the
high volume of information that must be manually processed [8],
or involved technical solutions that were not easily accessible by
public authorities, e.g., requiring the access to satellite images [14].
This paper presents an approach developed as part of the COm-
munity –Based Organized Littering (COBOL) project [2]. It aims to
deliver lightweight littering reporting, engaging all the stakehold-
ers playing a role in the littering disposal process, including citizens.
In particular, our work considers the following key challenges:
– Abandoned waste is mainly the consequence of unethical and
illegal behavior of citizens. Involving the citizens themselves in
removing the waste has both short-term and long-term effects.
In the short term, if citizens proactively engage in waste disposal,
the environment will be cleaner. In the long term, the involvement
of the citizens can likely increase awareness and respect for
the environment, our cities, and our countryside, prospectively
reducing the amount of abandoned waste through education.
– Waste removal may involve non-trivial processes. Depending on
the nature of the waste, different agencies and organizations
may need to be involved and synchronized. For instance, expired

drugs must be managed by specific operators since they can de-
velop toxic substances, asbestos requires procedures that involve
specific companies and protective measures, while other waste
could be even and simply disposed of by citizens (e.g., as in the
initiative launched by the European Environment Agency in 2018
to remove plastic littering from beaches [1]). In a nutshell, to
effectively handle the waste disposal process, solutions that can
handle the design and execution of sophisticated processes involving
multiple actors are needed.
– To establish solutions that go beyond the straightforward capa-
bility of submitting reports through web and mobile apps, it is
necessary to consider that the waste disposal process is context-
dependent, that is, the same waste might need to be handled
differently depending, for instance, on the place where it has
been abandoned (e.g., littering managed in big cities, towns, ru-
ral areas, or the countryside), and on the administrations and
organizations that will be responsible for its disposal, making
impossible the design of a ‘one-fit-all’ solution.
– To know how effective a process is, it is important to continu-
ously monitor results and further incentivize both citizens and
public authorities to participate in the waste removal process.
Proper key performance indicators (KPIs) and publicly accessible
dashboards must be designed.
To address these challenges, we propose to combine a model-
driven solution, which can manage various contexts and deal with
unexpected events, guiding citizens and authorities in the waste
disposal process effectively, with a digital process twin, which fa-
cilitates the accurate development and continuous refinement of
the littering management process. In particular, a digital process
twin operating at runtime enables the system to adapt dynamically
to real-time changes and unexpected events without re-deploying
the entire system. This adaptability ensures that the system can
maintain high efficiency and service quality, even under varying
conditions, continuously learning from accumulating data, leading
to progressively optimized performance.
The concept of process digital twin has already been used to ana-
lyze and support the waste management process, and specifically
to analyze the performance costs and the service quality in some
countries [3, 6]. We aim to bring this conceptualization into the
context of littering management, where the digital process twin can
collect and analyze real-time data coming from the environment,
reflecting the system’s current and future states and providing
functionalities such as process optimization and simulation to let
the system assist stakeholders and operators in the waste disposal
process definition and enable the self-adaptation of the processes,
to deal with unexpected events.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses waste dis-
posal processes in place in different areas, highlighting differences,
commonalities, and complexities. Section 3 describes our Digital
Twin Process Modeling solution. Section 4 presents related work.
Finally, Section 5 provides concluding remarks.

On the Need of Process Modeling
The proposed solution shall be easily applicable to different con-
texts, which may involve multiple organizations working according
to different (imperfect) protocols and different types of waste. Man-
aging waste disposal procedures based on different guidelines is
challenging due to their differing nature, making standardization
difficult. However, among all the differences, the procedures may
share commonalities regarding involved stakeholders, operational
procedures, required documentation, etc. Additionally, the inher-
ent complexity of these procedures makes it difficult to create a
standardized approach. We will illustrate these cases below.
Differences. As an example of a typical difference characterizing
two or more waste disposal processes, we report two interesting
procedures for the disposal of animal carcasses, based on guide-
lines defined by two different authorities, namely NetRegs1 and
the Abruzzo region in an official bulletin2. The difference here re-
lies on the fact that the guidelines target different subjects, thus
foreseeing different procedures. The NetRegs’ guidelines specifi-
cally target the companies responsible of the disposal processes.
Whereas, the Abruzzo region’s guidelines target the many stake-
holders that might be involved in the disposal of animal carcasses
(e.g., public administrations, citizens, disposal operators). A well-
defined process model might serve as a common language among
all these stakeholders [7]. This can improve communication and
collaboration, ensuring that all participants clearly understand their
responsibilities and the operations to be followed.
Commonalities. Despite the different nature of the two men-
tioned guidelines, we can observe commonalities between them.
For instance, they both differentiate the operations by geographical
area. NetRegs specifies different regulations for Northern Ireland
and Scotland. Instead, the Abruzzo region distinguishes between
non-protected and protected areas. To deal with cases like this
one, process modeling can be used to flexibility supports adapta-
tion of standard processes to the specific case, while maintaining
a common operational foundation (e.g., defining a parametric pro-
cess that works differently depending on the type of local area).
This allows customized solutions for each area of interest without
compromising overall uniformity and coherence of the procedure.
Complexities. A common aspect of the reported procedures is
that we can observe a certain level of fragmentation and intricacy
that make the processes complex to model or describe. A sample
waste disposal procedure that shows the complex nature of such
processes is the one about the disposal of abandoned asbestos. It
represents one of the major problems in Italy due to the complexity
and costs of disposal, not to mention the possible health risks. For
this reason, it is not unusual to find abandoned sites with asbestos
mixed with other building materials. Disposing and cleaning a site
with asbestos requires communication with the municipality and
the local police department. After a visit from the representatives
of these entities, a private company specialized in the field will
be involved in the disposal process. However, before proceeding
with the actual disposal, the health department must be informed to
check for any health risks. All these operations will be assisted with
documents, forms to be filled in, material to be sampled, and com-
munications, to name a few3. These operations’ intricate nature and

fragmentation demonstrate the need for rigorous and well-defined
processes that can define clear procedures and master complexity.
Furthermore, the ability to adapt these models to accommodate the
varying regional requirements and constraints is crucial for ensur-
ing efficient and standardized waste disposal processes. Moreover,
in specific contexts, there is also the need for self-adaptation of the
procedures to dynamic conditions. For instance, the procedure de-
fined in the bulletin provided by the Abruzzo region distinguishes
different sub-processes depending on the condition of the carcass
at the moment of the discovery. Specifically, if a suspect commits
any illegal acts against animals, a specific judicial police procedure
must be activated. However, in case of suspected infectious diseases
or risks to public health, the handling of the carcass has to follow a
different procedure, w.r.t. the basic one.

Digital Twin Process Modeling for Waste
Management
Figure 1 represents the architecture we designed (not yet imple-
mented) to address the above-mentioned challenges. The architec-
ture is composed of 3 platforms, namely: the Crowdsourcing, the
Modeling, and the Runtime platforms. The crowdsourcing platform
collects information from citizens, operators, and vehicles through
a web app, which also implements a Mobile front-end, shares the
collected data with the running processes, and provides a dashboard
for data visualization (e.g., to visualize the ranks generated by the
gamification logic, or to visualize the waste reported in the area).
The runtime platform runs various services and processes, such as
simulation and optimization, to effectively respond to (unexpected)
inputs from the physical world in real time. This supports the
process’s self-adaptation at runtime, enabling immediate problem
resolution. To make accurate and informed decisions, the modeling
platform hosts the digital twins of the monitored areas, mimicking
the actual activities required for handling, managing, and disposing
of waste.
We describe the three platforms that constitute our architecture
in the following sections.
3.1
Crowdsourcing Platform
Citizens shall contribute to littering by reporting geo-localized pic-
tures of waste through a dedicated mobile app, as is already possible
with several other systems. Pictures shall include metadata, such as
the image’s geolocation. The collected data will be anonymized on
the fly to avoid disclosing sensitive information. The crowdsourcing
platform involves citizens in the waste disposal process, asking and
providing them additional information about (a) the nature of the
waste, (b) the process that should be followed to remove and/or
dispose of the waste, and (c) the contacts to reach the organizations
that can dispose of the specifically detected waste when it cannot be
simply removed and brought to a landfill. All parties participating
in the waste management process (not only citizens) are engaged
to be successful.
The proposed approach also establishes gamified processes for
both citizens and administrations. Citizens will be rewarded for
reporting and removing waste and for confirming or disproving
waste removal actions taken by other actors. Administrations will
compete on their ability to keep areas clean based on citizens’
reports. Further, the indexes derived from the collected data could
be used by administrations to demonstrate the impact of actions
regarding littering management, as well as in the context of the
SDGs4.
It is important to remark that the gamification and rewarding
processes are modeled processes themselves. Different administra-
tions can model these processes according to other rules (using the
modeling platform). This guarantees that the waste management
and reward processes are decoupled on the one hand, that is, they
are modeled separately, but they are also interdependent on the
other hand since the events and data generated by the waste man-
agement process represent the most relevant source of information
for the definition of the reward system. The modeling platform
must guarantee the coherence of these two processes.
Citizens and operators will exploit a dashboard populated with
crowdsourced data, jointly with the data computed by the pro-
cesses (e.g., the reward process and the digital process twins), to
obtain information about the waste to be disposed of and the ranks
generated by the gamification system.
3.2
Modeling Platform
Waste disposal may include numerous processes, such as collec-
tion, transportation, treatment, and recycling. Each contains dif-
ferent stakeholders and a certain degree of variability caused by
the specific context in which the disposal happens, as anticipated
in Section 2. In this architecture, we propose to exploit process
modeling as a fundamental element in identifying and modulariz-
ing these processes and actors involved, making them reusable in
different contexts and also facilitating the specification of processes
that could be complex. This modular approach reduces duplication
of efforts, increases operational efficiency, and allows for easier
management of process variations.
For this reason, the architecture will combine two technical
facets: model-driven development and self-adaptive technologies.
Model-driven development (MDD) is exploited to define and cus-
tomize processes to the specific usage context. We use process mod-
eling with a standard business process language, such as BPMN
notation with possible extensions if needed, to rigorously specify
our disposal processes. However, workflow automation tools can
also be explored, being based on the same formalism. This permits
the creation of a clear and detailed visual representation of various
waste disposal processes while also incorporating the collaboration
between different stakeholders.
The modeling platform allows the management and graphical
definition of two main types of processes: waste management pro-
cesses, which involve the collection, transportation, and disposal
of waste, and the rewarding processes, which define policies to
assign incentives to citizens for proper waste reporting, waste sep-
aration, and recycling. These processes are closely interconnected
and communicate with each other to ensure efficient and integrated
management. Communication between these processes is crucial, as
the data collected from the waste management process can directly
influence the rewards given in the rewarding process.
Those processes are defined through a web-based modeling tool,
persisted in a dedicated model repository, and handled by a process

manager entity, which coordinates the various processes and a
digital cockpit. The digital cockpit is the focal point for monitoring
and controlling operations in real-time, ensuring a comprehensive
and detailed view of ongoing activities. Decision makers interact
with the digital cockpit to analyze the ongoing activities and KPIs
trends and make informed decisions based on the insights. For
instance, a hot area with a high frequency of abandoned sites may
be targeted by local police, etc.
Since decision-makers may belong to different organizations
(e.g., the municipality or the agency waste disposal agency), they
will have their own visibility and change rights on the processes.
For instance, the transportation agency may define how transporta-
tion should work but cannot change the waste disposal processes
in the landfill, although they will also have the visibility of these
processes. Collaborative editing of the process will be governed
through process model slicing solutions [15] that will ensure col-
laboration while respecting ownership of the processes.
The modeling platform will also embed analysis routines to check
that the final waste disposal process resulting from the composition
of all processes provides the correct behavior; for instance, every
abandoned waste will eventually be disposed of. Process analysis is
crucial to guarantee that every citizen receives the proper level of
service and that procedures are followed correctly and uniformly.
Finally, self-adaptive technologies will be exploited to enrich
processes with the capability to self-organize in case of unexpected
events through a digital twin of the processes. For example, if the
appropriate person to handle a notification is on vacation, the sys-
tem will automatically redirect the notification to another suitable
individual. These rules may be specified with a notation suitable
for defining heuristics or general adaptation rules for each process.
3.3
Runtime Platform
Once the processes are modeled, they can be executed at runtime
inside the runtime platform through a process engine component.
While being executed, these processes can invoke services such
as prediction, optimization, simulation, and many others based on
real-time input data from the physical world.
For example, simulations might show the impact of adding more
litter bins in a specific area or the effectiveness of public aware-
ness campaigns. Meanwhile, optimization services could address
situations where the designated cleanup crew is unavailable by
generating a new resource allocation and task schedule. All these
simulations and analyses may be enabled by replicating the models
on which the system reacts. Indeed, the entire runtime platform
communicates with the underlying models like an interpreter of
the processes defined by decision-makers. The same processes are
interpreted at runtime when invoked by the Crowdsourcing plat-
form. For instance, when a new report is submitted through the
crowdsourcing system, e.g., via the mobile app, the same report trig-
gers moderation actions by the relevant entities. When the operator
validates the reported littering site, the specific process activates
the next step, and so on. Such ongoing communications between
the process models, the runtime engine, and the actual system are
dribbled as a digital process twin.
This dynamic invocation of services enables the processes to be
highly responsive and adaptive, ensuring that waste management
processes remain effective and resilient despite unexpected events
or changing conditions. Since the process engine can be pretty
demanding and the workload partially unpredictable, we will deploy
and run services on the cloud to guarantee scalability.

Related Work
Several studies try to address the waste management process through
digital process twins. Cárdenas et al. address the waste management
problem in South Africa using a prototype digital twin [5]. They
focus on stakeholder prioritization and citizen engagement using an
open-source tool for identifying waste containers and disposal sites
and waste generation simulations via a control dashboard. Burkhart
et al. propose a process digital twin to support the decision-making
activities to find a compromise between costs and quality of ser-
vices using smart waste bins in Switzerland [3]. The digital twin
provides benchmarks for implementing similar systems in other
municipalities and presents an innovative key performance indica-
tor to measure service quality. However, a significant drawback is
that the proposed works do not use modeling to develop or repre-
sent the processes or the digital twin. Without such modeling, the
system lacks a detailed blueprint for its implementation and refine-
ment. Further, none of the work addresses optimizing or creating a
self-adaptive runtime environment for managing the waste disposal
process. The lack of self-adaptation limits the system’s ability to
dynamically adjust to changing conditions and improve efficiency
in real-time, reducing its overall effectiveness and responsiveness.
Modeling management processes at runtime has emerged as a
promising approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
of handling (unexpected) events [9, 16]. These models prevent
error-prone and time-consuming manual process adaptations, al-
lowing systems to adapt dynamically to environmental changes.
This makes them particularly suitable for the unpredictable nature
of littering activities. Business processes, in particular, exhibit posi-
tive evidence in capturing processes specification and monitoring
activities to identify possible improvements and necessary adap-
tations at runtime [4, 9, 11]. Traditional notation languages, such
as BPMN, graphically support modelers through a narrow space
of solutions for activity specification and provide a mechanism to
specify how the system will react to expected exceptions.
Santana et al. propose a BPMN-based business process to facil-
itate requirements engineering in a complex waste management
scenario, starting from material acquisition and ending with residue
disposal. However, no specifications about the deployment of the
actual system or possible changes in the process are discussed [13].
Pelonero et al. present a smart citizen-rewarding process for en-
hancing user garbage collection through an IoT-based service that
promotes waste recycling in door-to-door urban environments [12].
Using QR codes and IoT sensors to collect and monitor essential
waste-related data, such as waste composition (paper, plastics, glass,
etc.), citizens can earn tax incentives through direct recycling. The
authors have not addressed the possibility of having a digital twin
and the self-adaptive capabilities that derive from its adoption in the
IoT cloud environment modeled through a BPMN-based business
process involving citizens and garbage collectors.

Conclusions
Littering is a significant problem affecting our society and threat-
ening our environment, including natural, rural, and urban areas.
In particular, the timely detection and removal of abandoned waste
is an open challenge that requires new cost-effective solutions to
be solved. This paper describes our vision of combining process
modeling and digital process twins to achieve self-adaptive pro-
cedures that can be used to control the waste disposal process. In
addition, the integration of a crowdsourcing platform addresses
both the need to feed the digital twin processes with actual data
about reality and the need to enable participatory processes where
citizens are engaged in reporting and removing waste. Future work
concerns fostering our collaboration with municipalities to develop
and experiment with the proposed solution in controlled scenarios
and finally obtain insights about its effectiveness.
